The Shikoku Pilgrimage is a roughly 1200-kilometre circle around the whole island, covering 88 temples and 20 bangai (side) temples. Below are, I have compiled frequently asked questions from friends and my Shikoku Pilgrimage diary readers who are considering visiting the temples, or undertaking the full journey.\nFor people who intend to walk the Shikoku Pilgrimage, you can go to my cost considerations and packing list.\n How does the pilgrimage work? Main Hall at a Konomine-ji in Kochi Prefecture\nThe Shikoku Pilgrimage is a route of 88 Buddhist temples around Shikoku. These temples usually have associations with Kukai 空海, also known as Kobo Daishi 弘法大師, the founder of Shingon Buddhism in Japan. Every temple has its own founding history and may have switched Buddhist sects over the years depending on the leadership. Information about each temple is found in the English Shikoku 88 Route Guide (2018) (available on Amazon, though it is more reasonably priced at Temple #1 — approx ¥1800/US$18). In addition, there are 20 Bangai temples, secondary temples, which pilgrims completing the pilgrimage can also optimally visit, making the total number 108 temples.\nPilgrims who participate in the pilgrimage are called o-henro, so you will often be called,”Ohenro-san”. The pilgrimage is often referred to in shorthand as the “Ohenro”, though the full route name is Shikoku Hachijuhakkasho 四国八十八箇所 and the pilgrimage is called the* Shikoku Hachijuhakkasho Junrei *四国八十八ヶ所巡礼. The sections of the pilgrimage are divided by prefecture as follows:\n Tokushima Prefecture 徳島県: Place of Spiritual Awakening 発心道場 Kochi Prefecture 高知県: Place of Ascetic Training 修行道場 Ehime Prefecture 愛媛県 Place of Enlightenment 菩提道場 Kagawa Prefecture 香川県: Place of Nirvana 涅槃道場  The only requirement for pilgrimage completion is that all 88 temples are visited. This can be done in any order, through any means, and any length of time. Anyone can be a pilgrim for any reason. Usually, pilgrims pray for one thing at each of the temples they visit. For more information, I recommend reading the website Dave Turkington has put together\n When to go Summer is beautiful, but extremely hot in Shikoku.\nThe most popular times to walk are:\n Spring: April/May Fall: October/November  The worst times to walk are:\n June: Rainy Season July – August: High summer (30+ degree weather and high humidity) Winter is also not recommended because the mountains may have snow  Shikoku does not usually snow, but the past few years have seen winters with snow. Pilgrims who intend to camp during should be experienced alpine mountaineers.\n Is there a proper way to do the pilgrimage? Walking staves left by pilgrims after they have completed their journey\nNo. there is no fixed way to do the pilgrimage. By visiting all 88 temples, every pilgrimage reaches their kechigan 結願, the completion of their pilgrimage. Pilgrims can:\n *Toshi-uchi *通し打ち: All the temples at once Kugiri-uchi 区切りち: Do part of the pilgrimage Ikkoku-mairi 一国参り: Do one prefecture *Saka-uchi/Gyaku-uchi *逆打ち: Do the pilgrimage backwards (thought to be luckier) visit the temples in any order take as long as you want (years) go as fast as you want (5 days on a bus tour) do it as many times as you want (some people do 100+)  In addition, pilgrims may also do an Oreimairi お礼参り, which means to either visit the first temple that they began the pilgrimage at (which may or may not be the first), or to visit Mount Koya, a day-trip from Osaka. Mount Koya is a mountain town that is the headquarters of Shingon Buddhism and Kukai’s Mausoleum is where pilgrims may go before or after their pilgrimage to give thanks to Kobo Daishi for a safe journey.\nThe various methods of getting around Shikoku can include any of the following:\n Walking (30-50 days) Cycling (2 weeks) Driving Bus tour A mixed method  Many elderly do the Shikoku Pilgrimage by bus and wear the hakui, white vest.\nThere is one unspoken bottom line for the pilgrimage. Irrespective of why most of us, I assume, as foreign visitors and laypeople are doing this walk / pilgrimage, one thing we (certainly, I, occasionally) forget is that to virtually all the Japanese who walk the pilgrimage, it is a religious act of faith. Our journey may be one of self-discovery, but it is not the religious pilgrimage many Japanese people take seriously. Our “ohenro-san” or “pilgrim” title is one bestowed to us by our hosts on Shikoku. As the Shikoku Pilgrimage has now gained international interest, it is increasingly important that those of us who do embark on this journey are mindful of ourselves, respectful this religious undertaking, and grateful for the privilege that we have been given to be allowed to partake in it. In that sense, think of yourself as an ambassador for the global community to Japan, helping to build local confidence in international visitors, so that future henro may also enjoy the same welcome that you experience.\n Do I need to know Japanese? No. You don’t need to know Japanese to do the pilgrimage. Knowing Japanese helps a lot for you to communicate with people, make orders and reservations, and generally get things done.\nHowever, if you intend to use your smartphone, then downloading an offline Google Translate Japanese package, as well as apps like Yomiwa (paid app) will be of great help.\n How should I prepare? I suggest searching various Shikoku Pilgrimage diaries, as pilgrims come from all over the world. This website is also an archive of my 40-day trip. If you are still interested, also find out:\n Cost considerations My Shikoku Pilgrimage daily budget Budget and free lodging guide (for a list of henro huts, temple tsuyado, minshuku)   Do I need to follow a proper ritual? Pilgrims light incense at the Main Hall and Daishi Hall of each temple\nThere is a proper ritual when going to each temple. However, everyone does it differently. Some people do part of the ritual. Some choose to do the pilgrimage as a walk and do none of the rituals. No-one judges you no matter how you do it as long as you are respectful of the places and the other people who go.\nAs a general overview, the proper etiquette at a temple is:\n Cross the main gate: bow before entering under the gate Purify yourself: wash your hands and mouth at the wash basin Announce your arrival: ring the bell (while respecting the temple’s ringing hours) Worship at the Main Hall: light one candle and one incense; ring the bell once; place your written nameslip the box and the copied sutra in the box; recite the sutras beginning with the Heart Sutra. Worship at the Daishi Hall: repeat all the steps from the Main Hall Collect your temple stamp at the temple’s office Exit: After crossing the main gate, turn around, and bow once again  Getting a temple stamp (nokyocho) after visiting the Main Hall and Daishi Hall\nMany lay pilgrims may not place a copied sutra, recite all required sutras, or do the same ritual for both the Main Hall and Daishi Hall. It is up to each pilgrim to decide how they would like to participate in the pilgrimage. However, if you do decide to do a step, it is recommended that you do so in the order that is prescribed. For example, ringing the bell upon leaving is considered bad luck.\nFinally, even for visitors who do not intend to participate in the pilgrimage, you may consider as an act of respect to bow at the main gate and upon exit. This is common etiquette in Japanese culture.\n Why did you do the pilgrimage? Met incredible people along my solo walking journey\nI completed the pilgrimage entirely in the summer of 2015. I had found the pilgrimage when I was looking for a long-distance backpacking trip that involved walking. You can read about my reasons in my Shikoku Pilgrimage Diary Foreword.\nA year before walking Shikoku, completed two long-distance solo cycling trips and wondered if I could do a similar long-distance trip around Japan. Initially, I had found the ancient Kumano Kodo trails closer to Osaka, and from there, discovered Mount Koya, and then the Shikoku Pilgrimage.\nI also have an academic background in East Asian Studies and have always had a particular interest in Chinese and Japanese history and culture. Buddhism has had a deep influence in both cultures, as religious institutions as well as philosophical schools of thought. Though my main motivating factor was essentially exercise and travel, I do subscribe to many Buddhist teachings insofar as it pertains to how one can conduct oneself through life. Ascetic training also had a deep appeal, as athletics have taught me many valuable lessons in life.\nWhy I started the pilgrimage does not define what I gained after. Many of the learnings I gained during my 40-day journey have lingered and I documented them in my Henro Afterword.\n How safe is the Shikoku Pilgrimage, especially for women? Aurelie came from France to do the Shikoku Pilgrimage on her own without knowing Japanese.\nThe Shikoku Pilgrimage is very safe. I encountered numerous solo female walking henro, and the Japanese are generally not the sort to do solo travelling. Before going, I also read blogs by solo female walking henro specifically rather than men because I wanted to get a sense of the experience as a woman. A dose of the usual caution is still needed, but make sure you can walk and relax to enjoy your trip.\n How do you meet other Henro? Is there a community? A Japanese, French, and Canadian walking the last mile of the Shikoku Pilgrimage together.\nYes, there is at least one henro community that I know of. It’s a Facebook group called Ohenro-san which is managed by seasoned pilgrims, both living on and outside of Shikoku.\nYou can also reach out to the henro on this list or read these Shikoku Pilgrimage journals although they are mostly before 2010, so a completely different landscape to the post-smartphone world.\n Are there customs or cultural things I should take note of? A family-run udon restaurant near Uwajima in Ehime Prefecture\nRural Japan is extremely different from the urban sprawls of Tokyo, Osaka and the Kansai region. It also differs from places like Nara and Kyoto, which were historical seats of power and therefore were amongst the wealthiest of cities for centuries. Shikoku in particular differs from idyllic rural poster child villages such as Shirakawa Go or the Tokugawa tombs at Nikko. The island is poor, with villages that have a high number of elderly. Even for those who speak some Japanese, be prepared to use your imagination when adapting to local pronunciations or dialect.\nPlease also have a look at my tips for rural Japan for additional notes on how to identify restaurants, what to expect of transit, and the pace of life in the Japanese countryside. This is more true of Tokushima and Kochi Prefectures. Ehime Prefecture from Matsuyama City through to Kagawa Prefecture’s Takamatsu is far more urban.\n"});index.add({'id':1,'href':'/book/docs/Diary-Entries/day-1/','title':"Day 1 - June 17",'section':"Diary Entries",'content':"=====\nKawata -\u0026gt; Hourinji –\u0026gt; Kawata\nTemples: 9 (Hourin-ji 法輪寺), 10 (Kirihata-ji 切幡寺)\nWeather: Cloudy\nMethod: Cycling\nDistance: 31.8km\n=====\nMy first two temples in the Shikoku 88 Temple Pilgrimage were chosen, as it were, by fate. After a long morning assisting my WWOOF host run a tofu-making class for mothers and their toddlers, I had the afternoon off. Though the farm is far from the Shikoku Pilgrimage’s starting point near Tokushima City, I realise that it is close enough to one of the temples deeper in the Awa Valley. I borrow one of the spare bikes and set out for Kirihata-ji, Temple 10.\nSince the pilgrimage is in a circle and has no rules on order or method, the start is less a destination as it is the place I just happened to be. I wanted to “get ahead” while still volunteering on the farm.\nRight after starting, my chronic lower back pain sets in and I face a stead headwind. Cast against a grey day, going through monotonous rural towns with ample cars but few people, it is a discouraging ride.\nThe temple isn’t quite what I expect, though I didn’t know I had expectations until I felt surprise. I’d expected people and open shops, even though I am going during off-season. Summer in Japan is rainy season, followed by searing heat in July and August. The shops closest to the temples are closed, the parking lots empty, and the temple grounds silent. The road to Kirihata-ji is an easy to miss lane, marked only by a road sign hovering above the corner. I pass the shuttered shops and continue up the hill. The parking lot, equipped with a modern washroom, is still three flights of stone stairs down from the main complex. Climbing them with only bird calls echoing between the cedars, it really does feel like you’re lifting yourself above the steady whirling traffic below and with it the cares of humanity.\nAs I approach the top, there is an electric hum that replaces the birdsong. Bees. I was expecting to see a cloud of them above my head, except that there were only a handful of red, demon-like hornets hovering just above the last stone steps. It seems like a first test, and that I am in danger of failing. Fortunately, the temple guardians part without a fuss as I muster the courage to continue up. Unfortunately, I forgot to bring money to buy incense, and after doing ritual washing, could only do three bows.\nThen, I realise I don’t have anything to pray for. I also didn’t have a copy of the Heart Sutra that I was supposed to chant at every temple. Does this visit event count, then? What a way to start. The afternoon spontaneity now has the slight odor of disrespect.\nWhile Kirihata-ji is peaceful in its hilltop forest seclusion, Hourin-ji is a discretely hidden amidst the paddies and traditional Japanese houses. It’s a relatively quick ride that is lengthened by the act of way finding.\nGoing around both temples, the lack company as the evening sets in is a bit lonely, but peaceful. It seems I can expect this for the month to come. I begin imagining going through forest paths in mountains and through highways alone. Did I I really want to do this? I could just continue WWOOFing, which I’ve enjoyed and would love to do in other areas in Japan. Volunteering on farms would mean I didn’t have to worry about getting lost, daily meals, being cold, or animals at night.\nInstead, I focus on noting the differences between the two temples so far — the layouts between the halls, the size of shrines, the carving styles. Even though I am unlearned in Buddhist customs, I find the subtle differences fascinating and am already wondering what all the other places will be like. But that would have to wait for another day. It is about time I cycled home for dinner.\n The Shikoku Pilgrimage is busiest in the spring and autumn and is completed by bus, car, and committed walkers who usually take seven weeks. Those who walk the route are called henro (遍路), pilgrims and O-henro as an honourific. Legend has it that the 88 Temples were founded or strongly affiliated with Kukai (774-835), also known as Kobo Daishi, founder of the Shingon (真言) Sect of Buddhism in Japan. You can read more about the history here.\nI wanted to pass my summer days by being active, going places, seeing natural landscapes, while spending little money and staying safe (always a consideration for women). While I’ve camped as a kid and love the outdoors, I have no experience preparing for my own trip, much less one alone. But if Japanese city dwellers frequented this route, it meant that it would be well-maintained and more accessible for me.\nEven though I am an accidental pilgrim, I feel like this decision to embark on something that has spiritual significance for others already makes me more reflective. Everything I notice feels like a lesson, irrespective of faith or lack thereof. The empty grounds feels like either a reflection of me, my choices, or perhaps what I will learn to accept throughout the coming days. The nagging doubt no longer seems like anxiety, but rather a test of commitment. The natural desire to follow basic etiquette while being uninterested in going the full mile feels like a process of self-definition. Starting in the middle, ad hoc, seems both like a reflection of my character and prophetic. I am struck by how many thoughts I have already from this one afternoon, but I’ll leave it there for now.\n"});index.add({'id':2,'href':'/book/docs/Diary-Entries/day-2/','title':"Day 2 - June 19",'section':"Diary Entries",'content':"=====\nBando (板東町) –\u0026gt; Itano (板野町)\nTemples: 1 (Ryozen-ji 霊山寺), 2 (Gokuraku-ji 極楽寺), 3 (Konsen-ji 金泉寺)\nWeather: Light rain + Cloudy\nTravel method: Walking\nDistance: 8km\n=====\nThe day starts briskly with a quick breakfast and a bike ride in the rain to catch the 8:16 train. It doesn’t seem a problem when I decide to go, but my morning commute from Kawata station in Awa City would take three hours to get to Bando, the stop closest to the first temple of the pilgrimage.\nThe station is a small one, reflecting the status of an outpost town. Nonetheless, the hospitable cushions in the waiting area and information bulletins for the pilgrimage confirmed the first temple is a short walk away. One other henro gets off at the same stop and promptly marches off after studying the map, leaving me in the dust as I study the flower arrangement in the corner and virtually everything else along the short walk to the main gate.\nThe first temple has a regal air that stands out at the traffic intersection it sits on. The wood on the gate is a dark sombre colour that’s stood the test of time, but nonetheless blends in with the dark green pines that rise in the garden behind and beside. Apart from the few visitors just exiting, it is virtually empty. The man sitting on the bridge beyond the gate feeds the pigeons, adding a reassuring warmth. Behind him is a row of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.\nBeyond that is the main hall, open, dim, but lit with a ceiling of yellow-tinged lanterns. It isn’t quite what I’d expected. I’d imagined rows of pilgrims chanting in a much grander, but simpler, setup like the ones I’d seen in Nara years ago. There is the single backpack left on the bench outside and I am relieved the other henro had led the way in terms of temple etiquette.\nSince it’s the first temple, I figured I should put my best foot forward and drop a donation for a candle. All the words inscribed on the candles implied prayers for oneself, or one’s family and loved ones. Without one that had a general wish that could apply to everyone, I decided to to ask for safe travel on the road.\nNext, I go to the temple shop to pick up the henro essentials. The staff and hat are the minimum, (candles and incense if you want your message to reach the Buddhas). To those I added a bell, because I liked the idea of a being accompanied by a cousin to the windchime. The hat I wanted wasn’t available, so I hold off and hope I can pick it up at another temple shop.\nBefore leaving the main hall, I light three incense sticks and send blessings for the future friends I have yet to meet. After realising that I have nothing in particular to pray for myself, I’ve decided instead to dedicate each temple to a person, in case prayers do get answered.\nAs I head out, I notice the staffs left behind by previous henro and regret my purchase. Many of these were nicer and I didn\u0026rsquo;t like how commercial mine felt — clearly machine cut wood. Was I just being stingy? However, as I pick up each of them, I realise none of them are quite what I wanted – my plain staff, tinkling bell, and green string. Just a few feet away, I find an abandoned henro hat (in much need of repair). Near disappointment and an instant elation seem to come in pairs. Armed with bought staff and salvaged hat dangling from my backpack, I move on to Temple 2.\nIn contrast to the contained first temple, Temple 2 feels open. I notice the assortment of cups by the well and take photos. After winding through the various areas of prayer mixed with a well manicured garden, you go up a flight of steep stairs to the main temple – standing solitary and secluded by dense trees.\nWithout a lighter, I borrow the flame of the single lit candle in the glass box, mumbling a reverent ‘Shitsureishimasu’ (excuse me). It probably isn’t good etiquette. I ask for blessings for all the people I will never meet in this lifetime. I feel I should address them before moving on to usual requests for people I know and care about. As I place my incense stick – the only in the large metal urn – I notice a rosary someone had left behind on one of the holding stones. Somehow, these little gestures are touching; someone leaving an important piece of the pilgrimage behind, maybe for someone else who needed the beads to chant.\nBefore I head out, I go into the Temple shop to get a stamp (which I forgot to do at the first temple). Knowing I arrived should be enough, but ¥300 insurance against future regret seems affordable. In any case, if I run out of cash, it is easier to just stop purchases!\nOutside the shop, I check the left staffs out of curiosity for the characters they reveal. One of them – a sanded stick – catches my eye. Again, I’m met with a pang of regret; was my purchase too commercial? In fact, I am so taken by the sanded tree branch I decide to take it with me to Temple 3 as a test run.\nThe staff is supposed to represent Kobo Daishi, who accompanies you even if you are alone on your journey. Wanting two of him seems a bit greedy, and I feel self conscious as every car passes me on the main road that I am trekking down. Even for a layperson like me, such small things suddenly have so much significance.\n Again, Temple 3 is nothing like the other two complexes. It is bright red newly painted gate almost radiates down the small lane that leads up to it. From the gate, you can see a matching coloured bridge, but not much else as there is a row of well-kept trees. Walking in, I stumble upon a team of gardeners trimming all the plants in the small garden. When I bow and place my incense, I think of my parents and siblings, whom I don’t think of often enough compared to friends.\nWhen I return to the washing station to get my staves, I notice that someone has left a few remaining candles in a plastic bag. I help myself to the anonymous gift with gratitude because I had someone in mind to light the candle for: my grandmother.\nFinished with my rounds, I get another stamp and happily place the sanded branch in with all the other left staffs. I thoroughly enjoyed holding it during the walk here, but that’s enough. When knowing you have a whole month of walking ahead of you, suddenly time has a different significance. It is abundantly available for ruminating. I wonder about all my possible regrets in leaving the staff. Related to it is whether I should have waited and found a staff en route that is personal to me. I am a bit uneasy that my staff is just one of many. Yet, as I walked the purchased and picked up one, I noted the qualities that had made me select the purchased one in the first place (its weight, colour, shape, carve). It made me think of people: one can find the most unique and suitable individuals to befriend, or more patiently develop relationships with people who seem ordinary, with mild qualities on the surface. The well-shaped beam I was holding, although not first class, was not poorly made either. Its colour, shape and weight will change with every mile gained. By the time I hop on the train back to the farm, I feel I made the right decision, if not the one that came most naturally to me.\nAll in all, I only took two hours to walk between the three temples at a pace closer to that of a tourist than a pilgrim. In contrast to my impatience with the ‘uninteresting’ landscape while cycling to my first two temples before, I didn’t mind walking alongside a major road through mostly empty and uninteresting buildings. The gentle rhythm of walking makes the environment seem alright because I have my thoughts for company, and a tinkling bell to chime in.\n"});index.add({'id':3,'href':'/book/docs/Resources/shikoku-pilgrimage-cost/','title':"Shikoku Pilgrimage Cost Considerations",'section':"Resources",'content':"Budget travelling is possible in Japan, and Shikoku is no exception. In fact, it’s probably one of the most affordable places to go backpacking in the Japanese countryside if have 2-6 weeks. This post covers the cost considerations for the Shikoku Pilgrimage, including accommodation, transportation, wifi, food, temple visits, etc. The types of costs are broken down to help you understand the factors you should consider for your needs\nOverview of Sections  Accommodation / Lodgings Transportation Wifi Food Temple Visits Essential Walking Henro Gear Pilgrimage-Related Gear Additional Costs   1. Accommodation / Lodgings A private room in a ryokan.\nShikoku’s accommodation price tiers are about the same as other parts of Japan. Hotels and luxury ryokans are at the top and can easily cost over ¥10,000 / US$100 a night with inclusive multi-course meals or even your own private onsen. On the other extreme, you can camp for free at one of the 50+ henro huts, built by local communities, to support walking pilgrims. For further information on finding places to stay on Shikoku (including budget/free accommodations), please check my post on Shikoku Pilgrimage Lodging.\nHotels on Shikoku are more basic than the big cities in Japan. You won’t find any Shangri-La 5-star resorts here. Many of the better business hotels are also clustered in the main cities of Tokushima, Kochi, Matsuyama, and Takamatsu. High-end ryokans are usually found at one or two famous location, such as Cape Ashizuri, but for the most part are not easy to get to as many may be in more secluded mountain areas.\nBusiness hotels offer basic, but usually very clean, accommodations. They are a reliable place to get a good clean up, and generally I find that Japanese business hotels like APA are better than the American Holiday Inn equivalents. *Note that some hotels have smoking floors, *so when you make a booking, make sure to have a reservation that isn’t for smoking.\nBasic ryokan and minshuku are like serviced hostels. During peak season, you may be sharing the same open room with a few other pilgrims. During off season, you may have the whole tatami guest room to yourself. They are usually family run, and will usually offer one meal in the booking, so if you want to save some money, you can request “Sudomari”, a stay without meals and it will be deducted from your fee. The ones that offer cheaper prices for pilgrims are usually around ¥3000 / US$30 and on my Shikoku Lodging list.\nZenkonyado are free or very cheap accommodations specifically for henro / pilgrims. These may be run by an individual or a community. Check in in my Shikoku Lodging list to see more details. This is mostly unique to Shikoku.\nFree accommodations include tsuyado, temple lodgings, henro goya henro huts, and camping in parks. These locations are in my Shikoku Lodging list. Note that this is a unique feature of Shikoku, so backpackers in other parts of rural Japan should not expect this, except for mountaineers who will find rest huts on some mountains.\n   Lodgings Check if meals are included in price     Hotels \u0026amp; Nice Ryokans ¥6,000 – ¥90,00   Business hotel ¥3,000 – ¥6,000   Hostel, Minshuku, Basic Ryokans ¥2,000 – ¥4,000   Zenkonyado ¥0 – ¥1,000   Tsuyado, Henro Huts, Camping No cost    2. Transportation I am giving ballpark figures in this section, but it is also possible to search for exact train, bus and ferry fares, as they are publicly available and can often be booked online. Tickets for public transport are standardised prices. In this section, basically anything under ¥1000/$10 is not accounted for. Transportation is broken down into two parts:\n Getting to Shikoku Getting around Shikoku  Getting to Shikoku Getting to Japan: US$1000-2000 (round trip airfare)\nI suggest flying to Kansai International Airport directly. I do not recommend flying to Tokyo because it is much further. The cheapest way to get from Tokyo to Tokushima, where the pilgrimage begins is via a highway bus (which is probably nicer than their American counterparts).\nI think most people should expect to spend at least US$1000 round trip airfare to Japan, though friends in neighbouring Asian regions will probably be able to find charter flights on Peach Airlines, which flies directly into Kansai Airport.\nGetting to Tokushima: US$ 50-80 one-way\nTokushima is where you start the journey. The simplest, most comfortable, and cheapest way is to take the highway bus and you can explore the Google Map Search screencap below. There is a direct bus from Kansai International Airport to Tokushima Station. The only challenge is that highway buses called 高速バス only have Japanese directories and instructions.\nYou can check Highway bus schedules on this Japanese website (the English one had no results when I tried to use it). You can also try this alternative Japanese bus website.\n   Sample Cost from KIX Airport One-way Fares     Kansai International Airport to Tokushima Station ¥4,100   Train from Tokushima Station to Bandō Station (15 minutes to Temple 1) ¥210       More Options to get to Tokushima One-way Fares     Bus from Osaka ¥3,000 – ¥6,000   Bus from Tokyo to Tokushima (one-way) ¥6,000 – ¥8,000   Train from Osaka 3+ transfers and US$100+   Train from Tokyo 3 transfers and US$200+   Ferry from Wakayama to Tokushima ¥2,000 (one way)    Getting around Shikoku Shikoku is served by the JR Shikoku (JR 四国) train, which covers the length of Ehime and Kagawa Prefectures, and part of Kochi and Tokushima Prefecture. You can check my JR Shikoku Pass trip to see the full coverage of the train.\nYou can use Google Map to search for train routes, which are accurate for times and prices. In some cases, it includes buses, but those may be more confusing or less accurate.\nThe area between and around two Southern capes, Cape Muroto and Cape Ashizuri, do not have much train access. They are served by local buses that come only a few times a day. I suggest you get the Shikoku 88 Guide (Amazon for ¥1728), at the Tokushima Station basement souvenir shop, and Temple #1 because it has the bus times and the bus stops.\nGoing to Mount Koya: ~¥70,000 Traditionally, pilgrims are supposed to go to Mount Koya before and after Ohenro. They go before to wish for a safe passage and after to thank Kobo Daishi for his help. Below are the fares for going to Mount Koya from Osaka (before your trip) and from Tokushima (after your trip). As the tickets are mostly standardised, the same applies if you are going the opposite direction.\nNote that if you decide to Mount Koya, I recommend staying over one night as it gives you more time in the vast Buddhist town. But even if you do not, you will likely need to book at least one night accommodation in a nearby area, such as Osaka or Wakayama.\nGoing to Mount KoyaOne-Way FaresFrom Osaka to Mount KoyaTrain from Kansai International Airport to Wakayama City¥870Train from Namba Station in Osaka to Gokurakubashi Station¥870Cable Car from Gokurakubashi Station to Mount.

Wifi: ¥10,000 – ¥40,000 / US$100-400 My local data-only SIM costed me US$4 per month, but I had to pre-order it and have it sent to a residential address in Tokyo. A local data-only SIM can start at ¥4,000 per month.\nPocket Wifi’s usually cost around US$5-10 per day. Hong Kong is actually cheaper and faster than the ones you can rent in Japan. A company like WiFiBB rents them for HK$25/US$3 per day.\n   Sim card with cellular \u0026amp; limited data services Monthly Price     Sim card with limited data only ¥6,000 – ¥35,000   Pocket wifi ¥9,000 – ¥35,000    4. Food: ¥1,200 – ¥3,000 / US$15-30 per day I lived off of onigiri from convenience stores, supermarkets, and homemade ones.\nConvenience stores are staples on the Shikoku Pilgrimage and throughout the rest of Japan because chain such as Family Mart, Lawson, Sunkus, and 7/i are open 24/7 and always have food. Selections always include bread, cold food like sandwiches and hot food (like oden) and microwaveable meals. A free microwave is provided and these convenience stores will always have hot coffee (usually for ¥100). A meal could be ¥150 – ¥1000+ depending on whether you buy a bun or collect a full meal.\nSupermarkets are more economical options compared to convenience stores. They often have bigger bento boxes for the same price as convenience stores. If you go after 6pm, there will usually be sales marked with 割引 stickers, which makes your sushi dinner a great value! Also use supermarkets to stock up on snacks.\nRyokan and minshuku may have meals in their room price. You should always clarify with the place you are booking with. For example, some places may give you a base booking quote that is ¥3000 for *sudomari *and add ¥1,500 for dinner and ¥1,000 for breakfast that comes to a total of ¥5,500. Another ryokan may give you a quote that is ¥4000 including a dinner, and make the stay ¥3000 after you ask for sudomari, no meals.\n Dinner: ¥1,000 – ¥3,000 Breakfast ¥1,000 – ¥1,500  Places generally do not have “bundle” offers or discounts if you do a stay with a meal. They will just add or deduct what their meal price is, so you are perfectly entitled to bring your own food from the convenience store and eat it in your room (not the outer dining hall).\nThe figures below are rough estimates and based on the assumption of 1 portion per person. I can imagine that some people will need two portions per meal.\n   Meals      Ryokan/minshuku surcharge for dinners ¥1,000 – ¥2,000   Ryokan/minshuku surcharge for breakfasts ¥1000 – ¥1,500   Restaurant fixed meal (teishoku) ¥1000 – ¥2000   Restaurant meal (onigiri \u0026amp; udon noodles) ¥400 – ¥600   Convenience or supermarket bento ¥400 – ¥600   Meal replacements \u0026amp; energy drinks ¥200 – ¥400   Vending machines (per drink) ¥100 – ¥300    5. Temple Visits: ~¥30,000 / US$300 Getting a temple stamp.\nGenerally, temple stamps cost ¥300. I have encountered cases where they costed ¥200 and I think one instance where it was ¥500. Some people also put monetary offerings into the collection boxes and the amount is up to you.\nThis section will hover around: ¥300 * 88 = ¥26,400.\nYou may also have additional expenses if you buy charms of souvenirs.\nPilgrimage-related gear is in another section below.\n 6. Essential Walking Henro Gear You can find a detailed list of items in my pilgrimage packing list post. The bottom line no matter what you bring is to make sure you can comfortably walk with your bag for a full 8 hours / 20 kilometres. Below is a general guide I had found before starting (although I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a scale):\n (Cis)males: 12-15kg (Cis)females: 6-10kg  Trans and genderqueer friends, please make an appropriate decision based on your body and muscle mass.\nPlease do not try to carry more to prove a point. I have an athletic bent, so I am all for training, but starting with too much is not so much training as it is risking. If you are planning to walk and camp, you will need to last for 20+ days, likely with inadequate sleep for a few nights. Please do what is comfortable and please try walking with your gear at home before your trip. If you wake up the next day and you are not sore, you should be fine. Most people (myself included) overpack initially. A sign that you have packed too much is when your shoulder hurts within 3 hours. If you feel mostly fine during your 8 hours of walking, but are sore the next day, that is probably a good amount.\nThis section focuses on prices and the larger items that people may have to buy. It does not include daily items, which are covered in my packing list post. Depending on the season, you may need to purchase light-weight clothing, as Japan has rainy season in June and typhoons from summer through to September.\nI think the Shikoku Japan 88 Route Guide is an essential book. Even if you have a smartphone with all your preloaded maps, the book not only helps with the route, but provides interesting nuggets of history and culture at each temple.\n   Item      \u0026ldquo;Guidebook/Maps: Shikoku Japan 88 Route Guide (Temple 1, Tokushima Station basement souvenir shop \u0026amp; Amazon)\u0026rdquo; ~¥1,800   Backpack with back support (15-30 litres) US$100-US$300   Hiking boots / Comfortable walking shoes US$100+   Light rain gear $125+    For people planning to do camping The packing list for the Shikoku pilgrimage is a lighter version of packing for a multi-day trek.\n   Item      Sleeping Bag ¥1,600 / US$ 16   Tent (optonal) US$100-US$300   Mosquito net (Optional, season dependent) US$100-US$300   Headlamp / mini flashlight US$20+    7. Pilgrimage-Related Gear: ~US$200 Buying the usual gear will include: the stamp book, sedge hat, white vest, walking stick, bell, osamefuda, candles, incense sticks. That will probably be between US$150 – US$200 depending on which styles you choose.\nI think some of the gear is practical, even for walking. If you are a follower of Shingon Buddhism, then you will likely already know the symbolic significance of each item, in which case, of course, get what you need. Speaking to other laypersons who want to do the Ohenro for cultural reasons, I highly suggest you ask yourself the “5 Whys” if you want or don’t want to buy these items. I explain why this step is important in the pilgrimage-related gear sections in my budget post and my packing list.\nThe prices below are ballpark figures as many items have different sizes and versions. You can purchase all of them at Temple #1, when you begin your journey. Also remember that the more you buy, the more you have to carry.\n Tip: Lots of walking sticks are left at Temple #1 and Temple #2 by pilgrims who have finished their journey. They are free to take.\n I bought the temple stamp book, the sedge hat (large), walking stick bell, osamefuda (name slips), incense sticks. I left out the candles, but you can get those as well to do the whole temple routine.\n   Item Cost (c. 2015)     Nōkyōchō (Temple stamp book) ¥1,500 – ¥3,500   Miei collection book ¥1,500 – ¥2,000   Sugegasa (Conical Sedge hat – small/large) ¥1,200 – ¥3,000   Sugegasa rain cover ¥500 – ¥800   Hakui (White pilgrim jacket) ¥1,800 – ¥3,500   Pilgrim white pants ¥1,500 – ¥3,000   Wagesa (Cotton or silk scarf) ¥1,500 – ¥3,000   Kongōtsue (Walking stick) ¥1,500 – ¥2,500   Walking stick cap / cover ¥300 – ¥500   Bell (for walking stick) ¥300 – ¥2,000   Osamefuda (Name slips) (pack of 200) ¥200   Candles (per box of 60) ¥250   Fudabasami (Pilgrim bag for worship items) ¥1,500 – ¥3,800   Incense sticks (per box of 150) ¥360   Juzu (Rosary) ¥1,500 +   Kyōhon (Heart Sutra \u0026amp; Mantras) ¥500 – ¥700    8. Additional Costs Visas The big additional cost can be a visa, which doesn’t apply to most people whom I’ve seen write about the pilgrimage because most of us have 90-day visa-free access to Japan. Please check your country before buying plane tickets.\nHot Springs / Onsen: ¥400 – ¥1500 per entry If you are doing nojuku, camping, *onsen *will be a wonderful luxury. These hotsprings are where you can get cleaned up. I took detours to go to onsens. Even if you are not camping, having a good soak after a long day is a good luxury to indulge yourself with.\nLaundry Laundry is a must, unless you are on a bus-henro tour and manage to finish the whole thing in five days. Ryokan and minshuku may have laundry machines and I remember using one for free in Kochi. Cities will have coin laundries, so look out for those! I don’t remember how the laundry worked in other places because I tended to do laundry when I was showering.\nExtra Stamps at Bangai Temples Bangai temples are the additional temples that are not part of the 88, but have close association with the route or Kukai, the founder of Shingon Buddhism in Japan. In total, there are 20 Bangai temples, which brings you to a total of 108 potential temple visits.\nTravel and Health Insurance You will have to check with your travel agents, credit card companies, or insurance agents to figure out how much this would cost.\nI have had accidents in Japan and did not have insurance, and a late-night hospital visit was definitely under US$100. Yes, it’s expensive, but in the grand scheme of things, it is not US extortionist prices. If you have an emergency, be prepared to spend US$100 and at least get it checked. If it is something serious, at least the doctor can advise you to go home immediately (which actually did happen to a henro I met).\nATM Fees / Bank Surcharges Forget credit cards. Japan is a country that runs on cash, especially outside of Tokyo and tax-free chain stores. You need to pay ryokans and minshuku in cash. Local restaurants are in cash. Temples take cash.\nI suggest you draw cash once, so that you incur only one transaction fee. You can do this at the airport because you will need to immediately start using the cash. Otherwise, do it at convenience store ATMs, which will be more readily available than banks.\nIf your local money exchange has good rates, consider coming to Japan with the cash in hand. Take out ¥10,000 (US$100) bills because you can break them at a convenience store by buying a ¥100 (US$1) item. Locals do this frequently too.\nSouvenirs Souvenirs can range widely, but forget whatever typical souvenirs you see on travel sites covering the major cities of Tokyo, Osaka, or Kyoto. Just remember that if you are walking, you will have to carry everything with you, which means you might want to pick up light items, or nothing at all until you leave. Generally, however, buying souvenirs on Shikoku will be more unique and reasonably priced than if you cross back over to Osaka or Kyoto.\nFor ¥300 you could buy a temple stamp and make that a souvenir. You can ask temples to write temple stamps on a piece of paper (as I did for the whole trip because I did not buy the book) and that would be one of the most unique things to give to a friend from Japan.\nFor ¥500 – ¥1,000 you could buy a charm. Every temple is different and usually has items that represent it. If you are a culinary person, this is also the price bracket for most local sauces and ingredients. You can either go to a supermarket, or go to the shop at the main train station in the major cities of Tokushima, Kochi, Matsuyama, and Takamatsu. You can also go to supermarkets, which sell local brands that differ even as you move between cities.\nFor ¥1,000+ you can buy many other local crafts. For example, Imabari towels are famous. Matsuyama is probably the best city on Shikoku to buy local crafts from shops in the downtown area.\n You can also use this handy Shikoku Planning cost calculator as a quick ballpark estimation.\nFinally, you can learn more in my Shikoku Pilgrimage daily expenses breakdown.\n"});index.add({'id':4,'href':'/book/afterword/','title':"Afterword",'section':"About",'content':"If you’ve gotten this far, I thank you for reading my posts, whether one or all. Since I limited myself to 2000 words for most posts, there are many thoughts left unsaid, significances left unelaborated. I will address some of them below.\nI am writing this in the land of pilgrimages. Every year in India, some 100 million people make a pilgrimage, whether Hindu, Jain, Muslim, or even Christian. Every year, for 40 days, an estimated 50 million men (women menstruating between the ages of 12-50 are unclean and cannot participate) take off their shoes to trek through the Periyar Tiger Reserve (i.e. jungle) to Sabarimala, the place where the Hindu god Ayyappan meditated after killing the demoness Mahishi. The banks of the Ganges at Varanasi cleanse an estimated 3 million domestic pilgrims alone. These are just two of India’s countless Hindu holy places.\nIn these trips, people who painstakingly saved a thousand rupees (~17 USD) will bump along on a lurching bus, or hard seat coach train for days to get to their destination. Families normally behind gated walls may march with commoners in their bare feet. This is India, the surmountable subcontinent when it comes to faith and spirituality.\nAs I sit in a modern cafe staring out onto the dusty streets with sandstone buildings, the thought occurs that this devotion makes light of the Shikoku Pilgrimage’s 1200 km circuit, which is mostly over paved road, dotted with toilets at convenience stores and reliable trains. Typhoons in summer, yes, but no tigers or poisonous snakes.\nIt’s been almost half a year since I finished Shikoku’s 88 temples. I’ve never stopped thinking about them. Here in India, the vivid memories stitched into the larger fabric of experience are finally beginning to blend in. I think it’s called digesting, and I’ve tried to lay them out below.\n After Shikoku I have an endless stream of things to say or nothing at all. I feel like I’ve changed a lot, or very little. I think of Shikoku nostalgically, as one of my happiest times, even though it’s also caused many things that normally would seem upsetting. The summary point is – I’d like to do it again. I am starting with that since many of the thoughts below seem negative, but are just realities that I’ve just absorbed along the way.\nEven though Shikoku is largely a mental journey, its strongest memories are physical. I have a phantom ache in my left shoulder, which usually flares when I am tense or upset. It is the result of continuing with an imbalanced backpack that had no padding, was too large, and had no back support. However, I’d chosen to walk with it early on when the problem arose. I still love it for its convenience, and the ache serves as a quirky reminder.\nMy sprained left ankle has shaken my confidence walking. It happened just before Temple 36 and I continued untreated. I kept walking despite its softball-sized swell because there was no bruising and I didn’t want the doctors telling me to stop. The price I am still paying is that it makes me wary of all uneven surfaces and keeps my head down on the road. It’s made me realise how frail I am, but it has also made me intensely grateful. This bittersweet gratitude makes me determined to properly recuperate so that I continue doing the things I want to do, not taking my mobility for granted.\nAlso, I sleep less, and tend to wake up early despite sleeping late. In Shikoku, I usually got up around 5:30 or latest 6am to make the most of the cooler morning hours, even if I slept badly when doing nojuku. My body has become accustomed to light and broken sleep, even if it makes me groggy in the morning.\nSweat was my most constant companion, day and night, on Shikoku. The oily shine on my once sanded-staff is a testament to how often I wiped my brow. I was walking through tsuyu, rainy season, and high summer; most locals and veteran henro have said winter was the better alternative. If I did nojuku, camped out, it meant I didn’t shower. With a shaved head, I often managed to use a sink or a random faucet to cool off and wipe my arms and legs. The stickiness inevitably returned. Paying for an onsen because of the bath it offered became one of the greatest luxuries I afforded myself at every opportunity. Even now, every shower and bath feels like my first. Staying clean after for more than an hour is a miracle.\nI take these physical changes as the price paid for an experience, a price I was willing to pay at the time, and a price I still believe is worthwhile. If anything, it’s working past the pain that gives an even greater sense of accomplishment.\nSome memories are so alive, they are the present. My perception has been honed for specific survival skills, while my response to many other things has completely atrophied.\nAll surfaces are potential sleeping spots: a parking lot, a washroom, a nook in the rock, cradling roots in old-growth forests, ramparts, under a table, are all good since that’s how I sometimes did nojuku. A floor in a building is a luxury. It is both obsessive and empowering, knowing that you can sleep anywhere, exist anywhere.\nI also reflexively notice power outlets. While I often got by without my phone, it was still a handy tool when charged in Shikoku. Since I was usually walking, I maximised my lunches by charging from plugs in odd corners of shops and restaurants. The awareness of resources in spaces lingers.\nI also notice how much stuff places have. Instead of blending into the background of a cozy home, I immediately wonder as to their use, and if finding none, find them curious.\nI have no problem waiting for hours, or taking a train for two days to get across India. After missing my train by a minute and waiting for 4 hours for the next one in the rain, I learned how to wait. Time is easily passed either walking, sleeping, or drifting. At some point, whatever needs to happen will happen.\nIt’s also slowed my sense of time. In a world where we can always grow more efficiently by listening to a lesson on a train commute, gains can be thin-sliced into minutes and seconds that race by. Yet, after that month of walking in slow motion, to the same 24-hours, I now feel that life is long. Before, I had a job, organised major events, help some startups and projects, did writing, read a ton of books, kept an active lifestyle, and socialised often; that would have probably kept me on the hamster wheel. Eventually, the efficient micro-minute investments would pay off. Now, I think more in terms of seasons: five years would be five chances to climb a mountain in the summer, or five opportunities to try growing a Spring vegetable.\nThe experiences of Shikoku were jarring for life after because even if they were uncomfortable, they felt right. Even now, they occupy an aspirational vision for me to return to.\nThere’s no previous version recovery. Despite being someone who highly appreciates aesthetics, choices for material things doesn’t seem to matter anymore. I open my closet in Tokyo and am continuously, mildly, dismayed that I have about 10 shirts (for 3 seasons). I prefer a life contained in a backpack. Resisting the urge to toss everything out, I’m wearing only a handful of the same clothes until they cannot be worn before working through the rest of my wardrobe.\nDespite being someone who loves good food, eating for pleasure is no longer a priority or interest. I still appreciate a quality meal (street food or fine dining), but I no longer need good food for gratification. I still cook every day and take care in the process, but I can just as easily survive on meal replacements. For hunger, any food is good.\nI’ve grown more quiet, and feel no social obligation to speak. I thoroughly enjoyed being alone when walking. At first, it gave me time to think. Eventually, I even dropped the need for thought. I like the settled peace of wordlessness.\nEven if asked, I have less to say about things, less of an opinion, and less of a need to be heard. Friends, this quiet inertia feels natural, even though I’m listening to you.\nSimilarly, I have less reaction to things. Occurrences just float by. When walking, a small mistake or oversight had large consequences. Alone, I lived with the results of my actions. An ankle sprain, an uncharged phone, or missing a train were all avoidable mistakes. The pilgrim continues on, and eventually arrives. Life moves on, and eventually, you’ll get where you want to go.\nI can let go of almost anything – a good book, my cell phone, a favourite expensive camera lense. Moving around often for the past 6 years means things often get lost, but after living out of a backpack in Shikoku through rain or shine, everything is reduced to a question of weight relative to use. Everything you carry you need; everything else you can find a substitute for, make due without, or borrow. Ultimately, if we’re resourceful, we need virtually nothing except the clothes on our backs, water, food, and sleep. It’s humbling and liberating.\nI make decisions quickly now. In Shikoku, the handful of choices made multiple times a day forced a decisive hand: clean up in an onsen now to feel better for a few hours and arrive after dark, or continue and arrive before sunset to have dinner? Hang around another hour here to charge my phone or hurry to the next temple, but have nothing to do after that? These decisions with direct consequences every day made bottom lines and priorities clear. The shades of grey were stripped away: you made you decision, made it work and moved on.\nFinally, I have no particular faith, but I want to kneel every now and then. Shikoku is where I first felt the profound desire to kneel, to express gratitude not through words, but through stillness. In my first week, I was drowned in a downpour with nowhere to stay when the image of me returning to the Main Hall of my first temple, Kirihata-ji, and kneeling came to me. I fiercely wanted to complete the circle, return to where I’d begun, and ask, or discover, what this was all about. In the end, I made it back to realise that vision and thanked every possible being – or just pure luck – for safe passage. It is a simple act that feels mysteriously wholesome. Every now and then, I now like to sit in the Japanese style, and just feel that small, quiet place, of nothing in particular, but a light, glowing gratitude.\nThings I’ve Come to Believe I’m a believer in positionality and that ‘life truths’ are just a reflection of one’s personal experiences. I don’t want to propose that you will experience all of these things if you walk Shikoku, but based on my encounters with other pilgrims, I think at least a handful of experiences will resonate.\n**Gratitude. **Probably the single most important word to all henro. Small things mean so much. In that moment, a cool bottle of water midday when you’ve run out is just as moving as a roof over your head.\nThe pilgrimage is made of accidents and coincidences. The specific ones we get shape our entire experience, and are completely non-transferable from one pilgrim to the next. Yet, it is a guarantee that if you expose yourself as a walking pilgrim, these matters of chance will shower you along the way. And, if you are thus exposed, you will experience the raw emotions that only walking pilgrims face.\nShades of gratitude. Shikoku and the pilgrimage itself create a bubble of generosity. Generosity is often so abundant it creates a nuance of reactions mingled with gratitude. How do you deal with the 5 bottles of water handed to you that you must accept, and would certainly need, just *not now, when they weigh an extra 2.5 kg? *How can you ever repay your host for a much needed extra day? How on earth are you going to fit the feast your host has laid out even though the futon they offered was already a blessing? These mingled feelings leads to another revelation: humility so profound it cuts into you.\nHumility isn’t real until it breaks you a little. Linked to gratitude, and the almost helplessness in accepting others’ o-settai generosity, one learns deep humility. One of the most humbling experiences is accepting while knowing that you can never repay the kindness, were never expected to, and perhaps that you’re just the lucky benefactor of an impersonal kindness (giving o-settai to a pilgrim is giving to Kobo Daishi). You’re very small, yet what you do seems so hard, and rather than look down on you, the world stops to help you along.\nThe world doesn’t make life easier, but it conspires to help you succeed. Taihendesune! was a common refrain I received. How difficult / horrible / insane. Yet, despite the gasp, no-one tried to stop me, to convince me it was impossible. They said it must be horrible, then urged me on, and helped where they could.\nFinished correctly is better than finished perfectly. You can complete the Shikoku Pilgrimage walking, cycling, bussing, driving, whatever works. You can do it in a month or over twenty years, backwards, forwards, or piecemeal. I didn’t judge the majority of henro that drove or bussed. I judged the ones, like me, who ‘caved in’ to a ride\u0026rsquo;. It felt like failing a commitment. One of the hardest things for me to accept was that adapting and taking the ‘easier’ way are part of creating an intentional path. Which could I live with: the humbling knowledge that I needed help for a second chance to do this ‘properly’, or knowledge that I completed it walking (but might never do anything of the sort again)? How do you want to get through life – cruising, being taken along, walking, or sampling everything? There isn’t a right answer, just one that’s right for you.\nWe live with what we have. I have walked past henro with twice my bag, and ones with half. Some used walking sticks even on pavement while others walked through everything on sandals. Some camped the entire route while others checked into a hotel every night. We all used what we had: time, money, physical strength, energy, willpower, technology. I always felt a mutual respect amongst walking henro, and we appreciated the challenges that each person had to face, no matter how many resources they had.\nYou’ll arrive when you do, one step at a time. No matter how much of a rush I was in, I would have to take roughly the same number of steps to get from one temple to the next. How fast or slow, was up to me. I had a physical limit, but in the end, I arrived. In life, every second is a step, but how every step feels is up to us.\nWe learn why we do things only after they are done. I mentioned that I really wanted to complete the pilgrimage early on. Before I set off, I thought I would complete about half of it. Yet, a strong gut feeling told me that there was some value in not only the process, but the completion. Going on the inkling that I would experience something, whatever it was*, *when I finished, I continued. The answer, when I finished, was simple: *it felt right* to be back.\nIt rips open a hole. I first read about this on another henro’s blog in her afterword. Her companion had asked if we’re all empty inside. I don’t feel the emptiness, but I suspect the gaping hole I feel is just my interpretation. I feel like I’m staring into an abyss that I don’t quite understand. Modern psychology would probably summarise it as post-travel depression. My mind swirled with a lot of life questions, and some initial conclusions. I sat on it for a few months and it only just lifted after I visited India (don’t know if it’s location, timing, or just coincidence). I still don’t quite know what has been jolted, and perhaps I’ll spend many more years feeling it out until I walk the pilgrimage again. I wanted to end on a neat, positive note, but this is the more realistic truth.\nLife is about the questions we live with. The final thought is that the readjustment to ‘normal life’, the hole and the unanswered questions are, in a backhanded way, the point. Like the walking itself, the challenge of life after it is asking *why am I doing this; *and why this way? It’s not a comfortable road and it goes round in circles, but it’s up to us to find happiness, contentment, and maybe even meaning for some, by the end.\n A Note on Dedications Normally, one walks the Shikoku Pilgrimage, asking for one thing at all 88 temples with the hope that Kobo Daishi will grant that important wish.\nIn Shikoku I walked with the people I prayed for at each individual temple. Their memories accompanied me throughout the hours. It began in a straight-forward manner, with the people I’m most indebted and closest to. They were people I was grateful to walk with even in spirit. The friends that followed became more difficult, as I had to choose a limited number, and the ones I instinctively felt an affinity for differed from the ones who ‘deserved’ mention. The process of choosing in Shikoku made me come to terms with one of the questions I’ve asked myself for two decades: why are we friends with the people that we are? Still harder were the people I was ambivalent about, those whom I am most grateful to for what they have taught or given me, and simultaneously the ones I was most disappointed or hurt by. In my routine life, their memories often bubbled to the surface, and would be gently pressed back down after I examined them for a bit. On Shikoku, these were the people I sat with for days, and yet, most of them I no longer speak to.\nDid it mean anything to dedicate to them, as opposed to another, actively contributing, person in my life? Does it mean anything to dedicate to someone who probably never thinks of you, and will never know what you did? I struggled with this not because I needed their acknowledgment, but rather that, with a limited number of dedications, did the past or the present have more immediacy?\nAs I got deeper, and came to understand the history of each temple and the environments they were built in, the dedications became increasingly intentional (Day 15 discusses this). Each temple’s character is as unique as each friend. It also made the process of deciding more aggravating. It would be convenient to say that we *shouldn’t *choose. Shikoku revealed that in reality, we must, and it is too often that we don’t. Without actively reflecting on the relationships that we have, when the time comes for us to choose, we cannot because we haven’t worked out a system of value relevant to us. We don’t choose because of what it could say about us. However, in the process of choosing, perhaps we begin to see the different types of significances people have, whether their contributions were brief or long, gratifying or painful. Perhaps we can make space to appreciate the people who have entered into our lives.\nAcknowledgements This is the diary of a solo walker, but is a tapestry of a hundred lives. While I tried to describe their generosity in my posts, the gratitude was often implied. I’d like to make their significant contributions clear here.\nThank you to Grace and Kat who both kept walking journals of their individual Shikoku walks, which were invaluable references and enjoyable reads.\nThank you to Mai, who gave me a Japanese name, which I felt smoothed over many new friendships and encounters along the road.\nThank you to Zenryu for your Airbnb advice, which saved me from a typhoon. You welcomed me into Japan, housed me, and provided the simple joys of life I’ve always wanted. I’d like to follow your example in the coming years.\nCountless thanks goes to Yuji-san and Masako-san from Ono Farms for hosting me in Tokushima, thereby enabling both the serendipitous beginning and perfect ending to my Shikoku Pilgrimage. You provided the warm home to depart from and return to, and its emotional value cannot be expressed. My thanks also to Shou-san, A-Chan, Nim, Valentin, and Yanie for their great company.\nThank you to all my scheduled hosts, Ayumi and Masashi, my host in Kubokawa, Tsuneto and Akiko, for hosting. They not only sheltered me, but offered me extra nights when I could not make my ambitious schedule. In addition to them, I thank the new friends who offered help and shelter when I was still a stranger, leading my ad hoc stays in Shishikui, Iyo-Miyoshi and Takamatsu, for opening your doors to a stranger. All my hosts sent me off in much better physical condition than they found me.\nThe countless strangers who stopped on the road to thrust o-settai snacks, drinks, meals and even bills are the army of cheerleaders that keep us aruki henro going. No matter how small the gestures, they always renewed one’s spirit even at the end of the most depressingly long days.\nI am grateful to my walking companions, Yumi, Kouhei, Aurelie, Edvaldo, Noriko, Nakamura-san, Ayumi and Kotaro, and the three dogs accompanying me 5km down Yokomine-ji, who were sources of inspiration, comfort, and reflection.\nI also thank the family, friends, and benefactors to whom each temple is dedicated for having done so much for me throughout the years. You provided this pilgrimage with meaning, and a treasure trove of memories I can always go through.\nLast but not least, I thank my parents for not ever asking where I went or what I was doing, and therefore not insisting that I search for the meaning of life through less esoteric means.\n"});index.add({'id':5,'href':'/book/docs/Diary-Entries/day-3/','title':"Day 3 - June 23",'section':"Diary Entries",'content':"=====\nTokushima City 徳島市 → Anan City 阿南市\nTemples: 18 Onzan-ji (恩山寺), 19 Tatsue-ji (立江寺)\nWeather: Sunny + Cloudy\nTravel Method: Train + Walking + Train\nDistance: (+12) 10.2 (+10) km\n=====\nIt’s my first real day! I’m up before my alarm at dawn and get up to prepare breakfast with Shou-san. It’s my last full meal at Ono Farm before catching a ride with my WWOOF host out to Tokushima City.\nWith the organic breads that Masako-san’s friends brought yesterday, the sumomo (sour peach) jam we made recently, a mix of harvested greens, and natto, we have a breakfast feast. I dig in with gusto: when will I have another breakfast like this again?\nAs I’m waiting for Masako-san to head out, I take photos of the small jar of red sumomo (sour peach) jam. These sumomo represent my stay on Ono Farm. My first task on this farm was to pick them from the tree in the garden. A few nights later, I was stirring them in stock pots with sugar and a splash of yuzu juice beside Masako-san and Shou-san. The following days, we compared this new batch to some remaining jars from last year. I never got enough of them.\nEven though it’s barely been a week, I feel like a different person now. My mind has already boxed away my farming life, making mental space to soak in the coming weeks.\nI hear Masako-san call from outside. It’s time to go! I grab my walking stick and toss it in the trunk.\n I’m sitting on the train to Komatsushima, the closest stop to Temple 18, Onzan-ji. It’s a quiet local route, with plenty of space between all the individual passengers. I laugh inwardly when I imagine how I look now with a staff leaning on the side, a bag of food dangling, a bulging backpack, and a weathered sedge hat tied on top. My entire getup has already put me in a parallel world to the ‘normal’ looking commuters with straight cut shirts and bags on lap across from me. I think about Grace’s henro diary: she describes feeling a belonging in the white-garbed henro she sees during pilgrimage high season. There are none on my train, but it doesn’t bother me. I wonder if I’ll grow to feel a belonging amongst these other pilgrims as time goes on.\n If it wasn’t for two kind grandpas who had stopped to direct and guide me, I’d probably have gotten lost in the short walk from the train station to the temple. Their friendliness gave life to the otherwise monotonous streets flanked by rice paddies and houses. They made it feel like Shikoku was ready to help at every turn, nudging me to keep going even though I’d barely started.\nI stopped to write: The world conspires to help you succeed, even if it doesn’t get easier.\nHowever, even with the light walk, my back is drenched when I arrive at the temple at 11:30am. I improvise my way through the rituals of lighting incense.\nNormally, one prays for something big at all 88 temples. Instead, I’ve resolved to dedicate temples to others. I wonder if this is the right temple for the two friends I choose. They have a Kannon statue at home, and go to their temple every week back in Hong Kong. Would waiting until Kannon-ji, a temple later in the pilgrimage route, have been better? Every temple along the route has its own history, story, and reported powers, and it seems like I should find the right match. Yet, these friends had done so many things for me throughout the years, including introducing me someone else who became an influential mentor and friend. By Chinese custom, you honour by order of importance and after my family, I am most indebted to them. Then again, it probably doesn’t matter to anyone except me. I’m reading too much into things, as usual.\nI snack on wasabi peas and procrastinate on picking up my bag again. It’s hot, and I’m frustrated at my uncertainty despite having a map. I can feel my left shoulder aching, and I’m bothered that I kept checking the distance and time. Why am I so impatient? Is this a sign that it’s too much of an undertaking? What will the real long walks of Kochi be like? I hope I’ll get into the groove. Actually, I must if I’m to continue.\nI watch the two other pilgrims that have walked into temple office to get their nokyocho (temple stamps). The two elderly men are driving pilgrims who get their white cloth bags carrying all the temple necessities out of the trunk at every stop. I’m amazed pilgrims can keep their tunics so white. I am already feeling grimy.\n About an hour later, I’m sitting down again. It’s a comfortable little patch of grass by the side of the road, shaded by trees, and perfect for a nap. It’s too early for a nap, but the sun is making me sleepy.\nAfter leaving Onzan-ji, I followed the henro path pointing past the cow barns into the bamboo forest. It matched my henro guide book, which took me through a little hill as a short-cut. The little red stickers with an arrow and a little figure have guided me all the way here so far. Some were hand drawn, dangling from the trees and bamboo along the pastoral path behind the cow farm. It is like walking back in time, to the romance of medieval Japan, with sunlight flickering under the towering green bamboo stalks, the path strewn with dried yellow leaves.\nEverything was so fresh, even though so ordinary. I take notes on my digital journal, my Journey App:\n The Pilgrimage winds behind people’s backyards, follows highways, through forests, and rice paddies. It seems to take you through life, right in the thick of it in a way you never would when too busy living your own life. As you walk by, with marvel, repulsion, boredom, it really hits home it’s just all in your mind.\n The paved concrete roads aren’t particularly romantic. The houses and backyards I pass have hanging laundry and bonzai pots spilling over benches. They’re open about their laundry despite the pilgrim traffic. It’s not like the historic tourist towns. I like it.\nEventually, I heave myself up from the grass, and the ants and oddly shaped insects milling around. In the city, seeing them always made me wonder if I left food out for an invasion. Here, they’re at home industriously climbing amongst the grasses and hardy weeds. A giant hand could crush them, but it doesn’t disturb their efficiency. I finally muster the resolve to work as hard as they do and pick up my bag.\nThe last bit to Tatsue-ji is a quick breeze into a sleepy town. What a difference this temple is from the last: right in the middle of what was probably once a lively town, with an elegant ceremonial bridge to cross into the temple grounds, an expansive main hall and two-storey prayer rooms, willows blowing in the courtyard, fences here and there to block nosy wandering visitors from causing pedestrian traffic chaos or disruptions to the chants. That’s what I imagine anyway, for the courtyard is serenely empty.\nTatsue-ji is supposed to be a sekisho temple, spiritual checkpoint, where the intentions of the pilgrim are tested. If found to be impure, they cannot move on. In these grounds, with a two storey veranda for me to explore and take in the view of the gold-leafed pagoda, the giant Kobo Daishi statue, and bell-tower, I begin to feel a temptation to stay forever.\nI shake it off and quickly light incense for both the Main Hall and Daishi-hall, this time for my maternal aunt and uncle, who are different in all things except strong characters, huge tempers, and unwavering generosity to friends. In the end, the years of Chinese cultural soaking means defaulting to family first.\nIn between the two halls, there is a little shop selling the usual things for pilgrims: osamefuda (nameslips), incense, the stamp book, and a host of charms. The ojii-san waves me over and hands me a stack of osamefuda. Thinking he wanted to make a sale, I smile and shake my head politely. Instead, I hand him a purple charm I’m getting for my aunt, and the payment. When he hands me my change and the charm, the stack of white osamefuda is on top. He didn’t charge.\nI bow and can only say thank you. This large stack of osamefuda will last me a while, as I drop names of all the people I’m going to pray for into the temple boxes. Hopefully, the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas will hear them. It feels like I’ve been given a voice up to the heavens.\nI write down my uncle’s name on the osamefuda, with date and where he is currently living and place it in the pile. My stack of white osamefuda was only ¥100, but I resisted the urge to buy more items and spend for the sake of ritual. Now that I have them in my hand, they feel so much more significant.\nI walk out of the temple with another lesson: no matter the value of a gift, if it is something you wouldn’t have paid for, it’s priceless.\nIn retrospect, this was my first o-settai, gifts given to pilgrims, which should not be rejected as they are also thought to be gifts indirectly given to Kobo Daishi (who accompanies the pilgrims in the spirit of the tsue, staff).\nI hop on a train to the nearby city of Anan and arrive by 4:00pm. I’m an hour ahead of my scheduled arrival at my Couchsurfing hosts’ place, so I kill time at a bookstore, looking up udon restaurants in a city somewhere in Shikoku. I take photos of the book anyway, reminding myself to look them up later.\nI am looking forward to a proper shower.\nMy Couchsurfing hosts are a young couple with a baby son with fantastic reviews. They seemed so interesting that I decided to skip from Temple 3 (where I’d left off the previous week) to Onzan-ji, which is Temple 18 just to match their availability.\nAfter I arrive, I play with Kotaro while Ayumi whips up a multi-dish dinner. Her 18-month old can already stand on a yoga ball and runs around the tatami mats playing with his various toys. As we pass the ball back and forth, it feels like I’ve put away my henro-self for the day.\nWith the hissing sound of cooking and frying in the kitchen in the background, I chat with Masashi about traveling and ask him about the various pictures on the wall. They’ve hosted over forty people in just a few years. The two effortlessly recount the stories as Masashi follows Ayumi’s cooking instructions to speed up the preparation.\n‘Ayumi’s a great cook,’ Masashi explains after he shows her the bowl he’s been mixing. ‘Like this?’ he asks her tentatively.\nShe takes a peak and says, ‘A bit more.’\n‘So where did you learn to cook?’ I ask her.\n‘From my mom.’\n‘She cooks all sorts of things though.’ Masashi pitches in.\n‘So who cooks when you visit home?’ I ask.\n‘Usually my mom.’\n‘Is it because she never thinks you’re good enough?’ I ask because my mom says I turn her kitchen into a war zone every time I go back.\nThere’s a slight pause. ‘Actually, I’m better than my mom.’ I’m in luck then!\nSoon, dinner is ready, and I fill my bowl with rice, fried fish, and veggies. When we sit down, I put my hands together: ‘Ittadakimasu!’ I have two more refills before I’m satisfied. The food is too good!\nSoon, they ask me what I plan to do the next day since I only asked to stay one night.\n‘I’ll take the train back to Tatsue-ji and then walk to the next temple.’\n‘All the way? They’re in the mountains with nothing!’ They cried.\nI hesitate. I’m worried too. I’ve been thinking about this the entire week. Temples 20 and 21 are both on mountains, and I expected to be doing nojuku (camping) in between the two. ‘There’s supposed to be an abandoned school and a hut after Kakurinji.’ I respond.\n‘Is it safe in the mountains?’\nTo my knowledge, Japanese mountains are as safe as you get, but it would also be my first time camping alone since family trips. I didn’t like the thought of being in the dark all night. On a trip to Nepal a few years back, I’d gotten lost in Kathmandu during sunset in a local area without any lights or traffic. Since then, I’ve never liked complete darkness.\n‘Why don’t you stay one more night? I can drive you to the next temple tomorrow and pick you up wherever you stop,’ Ayumi offered.\nIt took all my willpower not to jump for joy. I couldn’t quite believe it. It seemed like a huge favour given that she had to take care of her son. ‘Hontou ni? Really? Don’t you have other things you need to do?’\nShe waved off my worries, ‘Really. Kotaro seems to like you. Plus, I don’t have anything to do and it would be nice to chat more. We could do Kakurinji together, and then you can walk to the next temples. We’ll have dinner together after.’\nMasashi nodded. ‘Plus, you can speak English to him.’\n‘Yes, you’re doing an important service for me! No, don’t clean up! Please keep playing with him!’ Ayumi says cheerily as she clears the table.\nI am floored. My entire week of anxiety was washed away in a single offer. All I can do is accept and do my best to immerse Kotaro with as much English as possible to repay their hospitality.\nMasashi and I continue to chat while playing with Kotaro and the toys he brings us. By 10pm we’re all showered, and I retire for bed in the spare room.\nI still can’t believe my luck. Following my intuition and skipping ahead to meet Ayumi and Masashi far exceeded anything I could have imagined. I hope my gut continues to guide me well. I fall asleep soundly knowing that tomorrow, I’ll return to these warm four walls, a shower, a hearty meal, and lovely company.\n"});index.add({'id':6,'href':'/book/docs/Resources/shikoku-pilgrimage-packing-list/','title':"Shikoku Pilgrimage Packing List",'section':"Resources",'content':"This is a packing list mostly for people who intend to walk the Shikoku Pilgrimage, though it can be adapted by backpackers who want to camp through the Japanese countryside. People who are driving or taking the bus will likely not have as many weight constraints and can pack more clothes. I have tried to outline the guiding principles for a Japan / long-distance walking packing list, so that you can use them to work through the gear that is suggested and adapt them as necessary based on the seasons. My three main principles for long-distance walking and backpacking are as follows:\n The season you walk affects your packing list. Weight limits are non-negotiable. Train and make trade-offs.  A quick note about the seasons. Your packing list for Japan, especially for clothing, should be adjusted to the season. For example, bringing layers in early Spring and late Fall will help you adjust to temperature fluctuations. In the summer, bringing dri-fit sports shirts will be more convenient than cottons. In the winter, if you want to pack light, then you can get some Uniqlo Heat-tech clothing and invest in other alpine sports clothes. In June, you will probably want to pack rain boots and sandals will be helpful for summer. In the summer, staying hydrated will be essential, so a bigger water bottle is better.\nThis guide includes the following sections:\n Essential Gear for Walking Henro My Mistakes that You can Learn From Packing List for Driving \u0026amp; Bus Henro Packing List for All Walking Henro Packing List for Nojuku Henro Pilgrimage-Related Gear  Essential Gear for Walking Henro The essential gear for the pilgrimage depends on whether you intend to do *nojuku, *camp out or stay in free huts along the route. This option is usually taken by henro who would like to economise on their trip, as accommodation is by far the most expensive part of the budget. Irrespective of whether you intend to camp or not, if you intend to be an aruki henro, a walking pilgrim, then you should aim to comfortably walk for 8+ hours a day (mostly on concrete roads). Carry a manageable weight and have a good backpack with back support.\nThe bottom line no matter what you bring is to make sure you can comfortably walk with your bag. Below is a general guide for weight to get you started:\n Cis-males: 12-15kg Cis-females: 6-10kg  The numbers above are estimates to help people find the right weight-to-muscle-mass ratio. For example, people who are taller or have a higher muscle-to-fat ratio will, in theory, be able to carry a little more than the “average”. If you need knee supports to walk or have a heart condition, for example, then you will want to adjust the weights accordingly. For trans and genderqueer friends, please just make an appropriate decision based on your muscle mass.\nThe best way to find the right weight is to do walks. Even if you do sports or go to the gym, please try walking with your backpack about 3 times before your trip. The first day will usually be discouraging because your body’s not used to the weight and distance, which is why it’s good to try a few more times to figure out what works.\nMy Mistakes that You can Learn From I did no training before starting my walk, so my backpack was too heavy and it severely affected my walking. I ended up sending two shipments of things away to lighten my backpack. If you are shipping overseas, it is risky and costly, especially when it is items like a heavy camera. In addition, I had no real idea of how far I could walk, especially with the heat of summer.\nI did not get a proper daypack with back support. This put unnecessary strain on my shoulders, especially my left shoulder. I still get a pain in my left shoulder if I am tense, so the chronic issues are real.\nAvoid summer at all cost. I do not recommend doing the Ohenro between June and August after I have done it in July. I had a great time and have no regrets. One of my big advantages was that I never had to plan ahead because there were no other walking henro who would stay in temple tsuyado (whereas they are usually booked up during peak season). Walking in June is rainy season, which is messy. Walking in July and August means insufferable heat for people from Europe and the US (with the sunshine it’s easily 40 degrees Celsius around noon), and the nights rarely drop below 20 degrees. It is humid, which means you will be drenched in sweat day and night. And there are lots of mosquitos. Having said that, I would probably still choose to do it in summer, but that’s because I don’t mind the physical challenges and prefer having fewer people.\n Packing List for Driving \u0026amp; Bus Henro If you are driving or taking a bus tour to do the pilgrimage, then pack whatever you normally pack in your suitcase since you do not need to carry it yourself.\nThe only additional items are the Pilgrimage-Related Gear at the bottom of the post.\nPacking List for All Walking Henro Backpack and Accessories  Guidebook/Maps: *Shikoku Japan 88 Route Guide *(Temple #1, Tokushima Station basement souvenir shop \u0026amp; Amazon) Backpack with back support (10-30 litres based on your physical ability) Hiking boots / comfortable walking shoes (preferably waterproof) Sandals Rain gear (poncho) and/or umbrella Knee \u0026amp; ankle supports (optional) Walking stick (highly recommended)  Electronics (Optional to me)  Camera (suggest mirrorless over DSLR) Smartphone Extra battery Charging cables + US plug outlet Pocket Wifi (Optional)  Packing List for Nojuku Henro My standalone tent setup during the Shikoku Pilgrimage\nFor people planning to do camping, the packing list for the Shikoku pilgrimage is a lighter version of packing for a multi-day trek. The reason it should be lighter is because you are walking over 50% of it on concrete, which would be harder on your knees than dirt paths in mountains.\nFor nojuku henro, I highly suggest you cut back on the electronics. They can make up more than 20% of the weight allocation, especially for women, which could really go to more useful things.\nBackpack \u0026amp; Accessories  Light weight Daypack with back support 30-40 L Sleeping bag (as light as possible) Sleeping mat Mosquito Net (essential for May-October) Tent / Hammock (optional) Backpack raincover (optional) Vacuum-sealed compression bags OR waterproof compartment bags Backpack liner or waterproof compartments in your bag Ziplock bag for passport, money etc. Ziplock bag for pilgrim’s stuff Water container Walking poles Eating utensils Headlamp Alarm clock (preferably wrist watch, not your smartphone) Towel – Facetowel / Handtowel Towel – Lightweight travel towel Eye mask (optional) Ear plugs (optional) Hooks \u0026amp; clothes line Pins / something to hang for your clothes  Clothes  Waterpoof hiking / walking shoes Sandals Socks (min 3x) Hiking pants / summer shorts (2-3) Knee braces / ankle supports (optional) Base layer Underpants (hiking ones that are quick dry is even better) Shirts / T-shirts (2-3) Sports bras for women Rain Gear Hat Sunglasses  Seasonal Packing List Items Fall \u0026amp; Winter: Buff/scarf, heat-tech clothing, fleeces and layers, breathable or shell jacket, winter sports jacket (that’s lighter and that you don’t mind getting dirty)\nJune (Rainy Season): Umbrella, boots, poncho (better than a goretext jacket), backpack cover\nSummer: Sandals, dry-fit sports clothing, bathing suit (if you want to swim in the ocean), sun screen, mosquito repellent\nToiletries \u0026amp; First Aid  Shampoo Soap Toothpaste Toothbrush Toilet paper (in plastic bag) and/or tissues Hand sanitizer Sunscreen First Aid Kit: Rubbing alcohol, bandaids, diarrhea pills   Pilgrimage Related Gear Walking sticks left by pilgrims at Temple #2, free to take.\nDo not feel obligated to buy anything at all.\nFor Temple Visits \u0026amp; Worship  Osamefuda (nameslips) Incense Sticks Candles Nōkyōchō (Temple stamp book) Kyōhon (Heart Sutra \u0026amp; Mantras) Juzu (rosary beads) Fudabasami (bag for temple gear)  Clothing \u0026amp; Walking  Sugegasa Conical hat (essential) Rain cover for the hat Kongōtsue (Walking staff) (pretty essential) Cap for walking staff Bell Hakui (white pilgrim jacket — with or without sleeves) White pilgrim pants Wagesa (cotton / silk scarf)  Notes on What Gear to Buy Shingon Buddhism, as a school of Esoteric Buddhism, transmits teachings through rituals and acts that have been passed down largely without explanation. So in some ways, irrespective of whether you understand what you are doing, this specific type of Buddhism could well argue that you should go through all the motions anyway. If you believe this, then by all means, buy everything.\nHaving said that, in my studies of Buddhist teachings there is no necessity for any material items. All items in the pilgrimage and at the temple, of course, have meaning. Someone can follow the teachings without ever having stepped in a temple. Similarly, no temple would deny entry to a homeless person without the means to buy any of the items, but nonetheless wanted to pray.\nOne of the main tenets of Buddhism is:\n色不異空空不異色 shi shiki fu i fu ku fu i shiki Form differs not from emptiness, and emptiness differs not from form.\n色即是空空即是色 shiki soku ze ku ku soku ze shiki Form is emptiness, and emptiness is form.\nThese lines are straight from the Heart Sutra, which is what pilgrims are meant to recite at every temple. Therefore, I would urge everyone to consider their reasons for wanting these items. If they have meaning to you, then get what you need. Know also that you literally carry the weight of your attachments to things for the remainder of your journey.\nWhat I Bought and Why The Walking Staff and Bell Though I do not follow a particular faith, I personally value many Buddhist and Daoist teachings of non-attachment. I do not believe in ownership. For this reason, I don’t see any need to buy a new, machine-manufactured stick that I call “my own”. Rather, I find it quite heartwarming to take up a staff that someone has graciously left behind, along with their memories and attachments. You can choose your free walking staff from Temple #2, where many pilgrims leave them.\nI have two walking staves. The first one I bought along with a generic bell, and immediately regretted once I saw all the beautiful ones left at Temple #2. I love wood. I disliked that they were all uniform and obviously machine-cut. Over 40-days, my stick has developed its own unique shine from the oil of my brow. The second stick is more naturally beautifu because they are polished by monks from Yokomine-ji, Temple #60. These can be picked up up at trail head of the mountain path up. It is in a box by the washroom hut, to be taken for free. Since the pilgrimage, I have kept both.\nThe Sedge Hat The large sedge hat is a life saver. More than an aesthetic, it is an essential item. It is effective shade against the sun, and with a plastic cover, a natural umbrella against the rain. I picked up mine for free when. I found a forgotten one around Temple #2. The inside was partially coming off. When it finally came apart, I was gifted another one by a henro who had to stop his trip half-way. His, with an inside lining for the head, was a lot sturdier and better than my ordinary one. I would highly recommend getting the inside reinforced lining.\nItems for Worship: *Osamefuda *and insense sticks For my temple visits, I only used osamefuda and incense sticks. I did use the candles for a few temples, but dropped it eventually. Perhaps it is because I am Chinese, so I see meaning in the incense sticks. I do not attach meaning to the candles, and also I disliked the amount of waste the wax created. Incense stick ash can be easily discarded in a non-toxic way. The osamefuda was for me to write the names of my friends where pilgrims normally write their own name. The osamefuda are also essential for giving to people who give me osettai, gifts, and so an important part of showing gratitude.\nI did not buy the stamp book. I collected stamps from each temple as slips of paper because I dedicated each temple to a friend and gave virtually all the slips away after the trip. I do recognise that for many people, the nokyocho (stamp book) is of significance as a keepsake for an accomplishment. It is also truly unique, as every stamp is handwritten and even friends who do the journey together will have unique books.\nA final thought on pilgrimage items I have specific reasons for not buying all the pilgrimage items, but I want to emphasise that the most important thing is to respect that this is a religious pilgrimage, carried out sincerely by most Japanese as an act of faith. Joining the Shikoku pilgrimage is not an entitlement, but a privilege granted by the people of Shikoku who preserve the route, build henro huts, offer gifts, and remain unquestioningly friendly to strangers in their backyards. In some ways, how we dress is part of how we, as guests in Japan, conduct ourselves. I have studied texts from various schools of Buddhsim, mostly Chinese, as a philsophy and not as part of a faith. For that reason, and my general aversion to consumerism and accumulation of things, I made a conscious decision to pick up certain items and not others. I also felt that, given my interpretationsn of Buddhist teachings, that actions rather than things symbolise meaning. An equal counter argument is that Shingon Buddhism, as an Escoteric school, places great importance on the meanings behind actions that are performed in a certain way, with certain tools. Short of sitting down over a coffee discussion on this, I would like to make clear that my choice not to wear or use certain items is in no way dismissive of their value. What I would like to emphasize is that no matter our leanings to buy or not buy items, I think one of the best ways to show respect for the pilgrimage is to spend time to ask ourselves why and make a concerted effort to consider the other perspective before coming to a final decision.\n No matter what you decide to do, I will leave you with this thought. A pilgrim is a pilgrim, in whatever form or fashion you choose to walk. Nothing makes you more or less than thinking makes it so. Have a safe and meaningful journey!\n Also, if you would like to get a sense of the cost of the pilgrimage, you can check out my daily Shikoku Pilgrimage cost breakdown.\nAnd finally, if you find Shikoku interesting and want to get an occasional update on new pieces, please leave your e-mail.

Slowly, I feel the tightness of my thighs, the tense shoulder muscles. Suddenly, I feel my whole body as one heavy mass. Through the closed door, Ayumi’s gentle coaxing voice does a tango with Kotaro’s sputtered wails.\nIn this room with a TV, surfboard, futons, and travel books, I feel so detached from the pilgrimage. I push myself up and head outside to play with Kotaro as Ayumi makes breakfast. It’s mostly me in awe of him bouncing up and down effortlessly on a yoga ball. Eventually, he loses balance when he jumps, and he laughs as he falls into Masashi’s arms. Kotaro seems to like the falling part most.\nHow I wish I could experience his perspective.\nBy 8am, breakfast is done, the table is cleaned, and we are ready to go. Ayumi’s car has a dangle of stuffed toys for Kotaro, but he falls asleep once we set off. Anan is a small city, and the shops thin out once we turn into the mountains. As we approach Katsuura, Ayumi explains that the town is famous for the summer Hina Matsuri. I wonder how many other small villages in the country carry on their annual traditions and modestly pack them away behind ordinary houses until the next year.\n The final climb up to Kakurin-ji is a single-lane road. The road snakes up the side of the mountain between the cedars. I notice flagstones between them – an older, steeper path. It’s the henro-no-michi, the henro path; I’d read that this section is an especially well-kept part of the old routes. The flagstones are swept clean, the light moss radiant.\nThis is what I’ve missed out on.\nThis is what I’ve avoided, I correct myself.\n‘I’m glad I don’t have to walk up this.’ I sigh. With my overweight backpack, it wouldn’t be a romantic cedar forest stroll. I finally feel justified for accepting Ayumi’s generous offer to drive.\n‘Yeah, you wouldn’t have made it with your bag,’ Ayumi responds with concern.\n‘Did you cycle up this?!’ I ask her. She had cycled the Shikoku Pilgrimage a few years ago, and I was eager to get a pilgrim’s insight. ‘It’s so steep!’\n‘No, no!’ She cries. ‘I gave up. I stopped somewhere here. I just walked up and back down. It was too hard.’\nI feel the car heave around the turns and I wonder if I could cycle up. The image of me slowing down to a halt and toppling slowly is both sobering and comical.\n‘How long did the whole pilgrimage take you?’\n’17 days.’\n‘What?!’\n‘Yeah, I cycled about 100 kilometres every day. About 12 hours every day.’\nBut where was her bike?\n‘Oh, I borrowed it from my cousin.’\nA hundred kilometres is more than any of my long-distance cycling trips. I feel like I’d been lazy, congratulating myself for a mere 60 or 90 km ride on my light road bike. In contrast, she just took off with an ill-fitted, ordinary bike. I guess it’s good to be a little ignorant to get started as long as you have the determination to finish.\nBy 10am we’re up at the temple, helping Kotaro up the steep stone steps to the Hondo, the Main Hall. When he gets to the top, I light my incense and offer some to Ayumi. She can be a pilgrim again for a day, if she wants.\nWhile historically the Ohenro had a time limit due to the Edo Period’s limitations on travelling, the spiritual Ohenro doesn’t. The only requirement for completion is that you visit all 88 Temples. Now, I feel it gives me the freedom to welcome others as well.\nKotaro is a pilgrim today, too. I wonder if he will ever visit all the temples like his mother. What will he become? Just the thought of all the possibilities, all the serendipitous moments that can direct his life, makes me smile. Isn’t life a bit like particle physics, with lives bouncing off each other, colliding, fusing, and separating?\nThe Muslims say inshallah, the Chinese, you yuan fen (有緣分), the Japanese, ichi-go, ichi-e. They all have slightly different emphases, but they point to the mystical combination of chance, fate, and letting things run their course. Isn’t there collective wisdom in these enduring languages? Why have we become so obsessed with being the masters of our fates?\nAfter we finish, Ayumi drives me down into a valley surrounded by forested mountains and blue skies. From the drop off point, I go through the shaded forest to Tariyuu-ji. The trees grow thicker, and the shadows deeper. I reach a rest hut with a beam of sunlight hitting the moss-covered roof and sapling tree on top. It’s beside a shimmering, silver stream cutting through the shade. Despite the mosquitos, I am reluctant to leave this spot, this moment.\nSo instead, I scamper down the bank and perch along the rocks, thrusting my empty water bottle into the cool water. I take a sample gulp and taste the sweetness of the chilled mountain stream.\nMy squatting view is a fallen tree hovering above the rushing water, with two mushrooms. The white one looks like it’s glowing in the darkness. I lean in and take photos, engrossed.\nSuddenly, time catches up. The grip of the forest loosens. I need to go. I climb back up the bank and pick up my staff and near-empty daypack.\nBarely five minutes later, I’m distracted again. Is that a crab?! A flat red creature crawls up the road. There’s another.\nAnother one ambles down to the stream. What are they doing here? I look around me, at the emerald broadleaves and deep green fir trees: so much like the forests on the other side of the Pacific, yet no doubt different.\nThe rest of the path takes me through a temple ruin, and a makeshift camp ground that seems to be someone’s permanent home. Would I have passed the night here? I imagine accidentally burning the entire forest down. I walk on, entertained by my overactive imagination, and relieved that I won’t be building a fire tonight.\nA bit further on, it’s a steady climb up log stairs. I pause every now and then, slightly out of breath, thoroughly soaked in sweat, wondering how far I am.\nI wonder how tall the Vancouver’s Grouse Grind is. A fit person, by the city’s estimate, should take 45 minutes to finish. Most take longer due to the sharp elevation gain. It’s my yard stick for mountains and these steps are much more gentle. I’m really out of shape. How on earth would I have done this with a full backpack?\n By noon I arrive at Tairyuu-ji, which spans the entire mountain top. This complex is as grand as its name – a temple for the mightiest dragon – and has special status as a place where Kukai did his ascetic training.\nI had earmarked Tairyuu-ji for one of my two mentors. Both my mentors are sleep-deprived, overachieving women who somehow manage to give time and significant investments in the people around them. One of them is chill and childlike (in her words), and the other is corporate, yet accommodating. As I walk through the grounds to the Main Hall, I know it will live up to the standards of the latter.\nAfter finishing my prayers at the Main Hall, I look down the stone steps from the cable car station, hoping to see how high I am.\nInstead, there’s a group of white-garbed henro heaving their way up the stairs. It’s a flurry of incense lighting, the light clatter of pennies deposited in the box, and murmurs of casual conversation. They have guide, who in a clear, theatrical voice explains the history behind the temple. Then, the hum of chanting fills the space, the guide’s voice confidently reciting the words at a rapid, but regular, rhythm.\nBy the time they finish, a lanky middle-aged man in lycra appears at the stone steps. A cycling henro! He gets his camera and searches for an angle to capture the imposing main hall. It’s impossible, so I offer to take one with him in it. His eyes widen and he says ‘sumimasen’. I smile and we briefly exchange where we come from and our plans before I head to the Daishi hall.\nThe Daishi hall is on the other end, separated by bridges, pavilions, and a row of lanterns. I feel conscious of the collective generations of solitary, focused, work that created this complex. How on earth did they manage to get all the materials up this mountain? Where did they poop? What did they eat?\nSuch a remarkable achievement is on an secluded hill, regal, yet open to people from all walks of life. Perhaps I’ve overloaded it with significance to try to explain the awe and peace I feel here.\nAs I head down to get a stamp, I pass a massive 600-year old cedar with a shimenawa rope around it. Despite its size, it is firmly rooted upright on the steep slope. It’s comforting to see such elegant old-growth trees so respected here in the same way they are where I grew up in the West Coast of Canada. A group of cheerful silver-haired ladies pass by me coming up the path, chattering away in pairs. We exchange smiles and greetings, and I resist asking about their stories. I need to get going. I wonder if our generation will ever have such long-awaited trips with friends.\n The walk from Tairyuu-ji down to Byoudou-ji is a gentle and scenic downhill. I cross rice paddies, seniors in wheelchairs out for sunshine, and shuttered shops. The forests here are not as wild as the Canadian West Coast, manageable, or perhaps well-managed.\nI’ve decided I want to do a tōshi-uchi, to finish all 88 temples in one go. Originally, I planned to stop in Matsuyama, about half way, because I have one month as a time constraint. It doesn’t feel right to leave things unfinished with all the help I’m getting now.\nAs I hit the first – only – intersection on the road, I see a vending machine by the gas station. Thank all the gods and Buddhas for vending machines, found in even the smallest hamlets.\nI need the highest calorie drink to make up for lunch. Sugary ice milk coffee it is! I gulp it down and slide the can into the recycling bin conveniently beside. Next!\nI cross the road and follow the henro arrows on into some shabby looking houses with vegetable gardens. Soon I head into another forest that cuts through a small hill. It’s a perfect weekend strolling route. Part of me regrets having to rush through the tall bamboo with their rustling waves.\nI re-emerge into more farmland, impatient after being chased by mosquitos. I need to get to the temple before five. Where’s the town? I keep going past irrigation channels, rice paddies, vegetable plots and houses.\nThen, Byoudo-ji just appears. It’s at the foot of a small hill facing a parking lot and restaurant. It’s so ordinary, so understated. I almost charged passed.\nInside, I run into the cyclist henro again at the Main Hall and offer to take another picture for him. He’s breaking up his trip into four parts and will do Kochi in the Fall. Despite my poor Japanese and his basic English, he leaves me his number and asks me to call if I ever need anything and also inviting me to visit when I’m in Tokyo. It feels like a gesture of henro solidarity.\nWhen he leaves, I quickly light incense for my other mentor. The name for this temple, Byoudou (平等), in this case means calm and balanced. Given my first mentor’s ability to pack so much of life into her 24 hours, it seems like a good mantra to remind her to keep time for herself too.\nIn the stamp office, I browse the few items in the corner, since all temples sell charms and incense. I’m beginning to feel that the shops reflect the characters of the temples. Some only have prayer essentials while others have full-blown gift shops. This one has a stylised henro map with temple descriptions. When I see it’s a mere ¥100, half the price at Tairyuu-ji, decide to pick it up. When will I be back again, anyway?\nThe priest sweeping the grounds outside runs cheerfully back in to write my stamp, apologising for the wait. As he goes back to raking the stones on the temple grounds, I sit beside the stone basin where I washed my hands earlier. The leaves and blossoms in the water basin add a simple, warm touch. I’m glad to have a bit of time to just enjoy sitting here, savouring the evening, as I wait for Ayumi.\n It’s barely 6:00pm, but I’m starving. For tonight, Ayumi’s got that taken care of. She picks me up at the temple, and after I’m showered, I settle on the tatami floor and play with whatever toys Kotaro offers. I keep repeating ‘more?’ before I do anything to re-enforce his vocabulary. Kotaro learns quickly to nod every time.\nDinner tonight is okra, mashed squash, and vinegar-marinated onion mackerel made in the local Tokushima style. Ayumi works efficiently in the small kitchen while Masashi and I continue chatting, Kotaro running between us. Then, Kotaro squeaks: ‘Standing’.\nWe stop. Was it my imagination? Ayumi was taking a video, and we quickly consult her iPhone. ‘Standing’ slips out of the speaker.\nAyumi and Masashi are thrilled. ‘I’m going to show his grandparents this weekend!’ She declares.\nI’m also touched. This is his fifth word and first in a second language! If it wasn’t me, it would be another Couchsurfing guest some point down the road coaxing him in Spanish, or French, or Chinese.\nIt feels personal, and not at the same time — personal because of circumstance. It’s humbling.\nBefore long, dinner is served. I dig in wholeheartedly, going for three refills before I feel satiated. Kotaro runs into my lap and joins me eating. He seems to like being asked ‘more’ before accepting the next spoonful.\n‘He really likes you,’ Masashi repeats again.\nI look down at him as he looks up at me with a broad grin. I guess he does.\n By the time Kotaro is bathing, Masashi and I settle into deep conversation about how amazing it would be to travel as your kids are growing up. Even as the henro side of me thinks I should be getting some sleep, my traveller’s side wants to continue making the most of our time together.\nIn the end, Masashi’s questions inspire me to write a short post about becoming a digital nomad. Even as my eyes droop, and I’m stifling yawns, my mind is excited by this spark of inspiration.\nReluctantly, we promise to say a proper goodbye tomorrow morning, before Masashi goes to work. I’m still processing the surreal good fortune of meeting the Mizutanis, knowing how different things could have been. I guess some parts of the Ohenro are meant to feel like a dream.\n"});index.add({'id':8,'href':'/book/docs/Resources/shikoku-lodging-list/','title':"Shikoku Henro Budget \u0026 Free Lodging Guide (English \u0026 Japanese)",'section':"Resources",'content':"This post is an update from the Henro free/budget lodging list that I had compiled back in 2015 because information at the time was hard to find online, but more readily available after I started meeting other henro on the road. The henro whom I exchanged lists with spoke Japanese, so the information sometimes differed from the English ones, which is why I compiled them. This updated accommodations and lodging list is not necessarily exhaustive, but I have added more information based on information received from pilgrims after 2015. I also have an upcoming FAQ for notes I’ve included for solo female travellers, based on the considerations I usually factor in for my trips.\nThis post includes:\n Tips for Finding Places to Say A Friendly Request from Shikoku Locals \u0026amp; Ryokan Owners Useful Henro Lodging Terms Henro Lodging List Additional Sources Photos for Nojuku Henro, Zenkonyado \u0026amp; Tsuyado  1. Tips for Finding Places to Stay One of the best temple tsuyado that I stayed at.\nBring a Print Copy of This List (in a plastic bag) With smartphones and cheap data plans available now, travelling in Japan is much easier than a few years ago. Nonetheless, I do not recommend that you rely only on your smartphone. It can die daily during long walks. You can save this article in your offline reader, such as ‘Pocket‘, which is one of the 10 apps to travel Japan I suggest. I also suggest printing a copy of this and putting it in a plastic bag (with your passport and some cash) in case it rains.\nShare Tips with Other Henro Other henro are like your weather forecast. They tell you about route updates, where to eat, and whether a tsuyado is still open. Doing thorough research is important, but don’t think of this trip as something you have to do alone. Greet the people you meet, offer information to help others, and listen to what they have to say. Often, people will ask you if you have a sheet of paper and write or draw information for you.\nLearning a Few Japanese Words Opens Dozens of Doors Shikoku has changed a lot since I went in 2015, but it is still the Japanese countryside and little English is spoken. Speaking some Japanese shows a willingness on your part to learn a bit about the local culture, which in turn, helps locals feel more confident about hosting you. Local ryokan owners want to ensure that you can have a comfortable stay and that there are no cultural misunderstandings or conflicts, which is often why they may hesitate to host someone from abroad. Download an offline dictionary and translation app. Also use Duolingo and learn a few words, especially ones related to directions, food, time, common courtesies, and making reservations. People are friendly and willing to go out of their way to help, so make it easier for yourself by having the right words on hand. I have prepared a list of lodging-related words in the section below for you to point to.\n 2. A Friendly Request from Shikoku Locals \u0026amp; Ryokan Owners The ryokan I stayed at before walking to Cape Ashizuri\nSince writing my blog in 2015, I have been contacted by travel professionals and ryokan owners. Some ryokans have closed their doors to foreign visitors because of past experiences. I’d like to believe these incidences were unintentional and cultural misunderstandings, but please take the time to respect etiquette by:\n NEVER not showing up for your booking (phone to cancel by noon) Always give notice if you must cancel or will be late (arriving after 5pm). The honour system in Japan is that 24-hour no-shows are are still paid for in full. Cleaning up wherever you go and stay — even at a ryokan you paid for At tsuyados, make sure you put all the bedding back and follow clear instructions by temple staff  Ryokans are small businesses and the families have to prepare meals and stay up worrying about guests who don’t show up. I’ve been informed several times of this and it is cited as the main reason some ryokans have given up serving foreign visitors. If you are making reservations, please learn to some Japanese. If you do not want meals, you can say ‘sudomari onegaishimasu’ rather than rejecting a meal after arriving. Please be considerate of local practices to ensure future pilgrims can also enjoy the same things you have. Thank you!\n 3. Useful Henro Lodging Terms A massive prayer hall tsuyado at Ishite-ji in Matsuyama.\nTsūyadō 通夜堂 — Free lodging for pilgrims provided by temples, usually huts or other buildings in temple compounds. Arrive before 5:00pm and ask the temple. Phone ahead during peak seasons (around March – May, October – November). Most temples do not allow mixed gender lodgings and only have one room.\nZenkonyado 善根宿 — Free/cheap lodging provided by locals for pilgrims.\nZenninyado 善人宿 — Lodging offered to pilgrims in someone’s home\nMichi no Eki 道の駅 — Roadside stations with washrooms, gift shops, and usually a small restaurant to serve highway truck drivers and coach buses. Shops close at night, but toilets are usually open 24/7. Listed ones have outdoors rest area with a roof for more comfortable camping.\nHenro Goya 遍路小屋・へんろ小屋 — Henro huts. There are over 50 built by local communities. There is a list with a map here ヘンロ小屋の案内 and I think JPilgrim at the bottom of this post also has most of them mapped in English.\nDaishido 大師堂 — Small shrine buildings. The ones listed in this directory are run by local communities and can be used. If it is not listed here, assume they are not available for sleeping in. As a courtesy, please ask locals before using them. Some have keys. Please clean up all your rubbish and put things away as instructed to ensure they stay open. Some have closed in recent years.\n四阿 /東屋 / 休息所 — Rest huts. They are public structures, so make use of them if you feel comfortable.\nUnattended Train Stations — These are usually small stations that are just outside small towns. Many will have toilets, though they may not be cleaned regularly.\nMinshuku 民宿 — Paid accommodation. Like a small bed \u0026amp; breakfast, these are usually the cheapest paid options. Some listed here have discounted rates for henro. Check out the places in the HenroHouse directory.\nRyokan 旅館 — Paid accommodation. Also a bed and breakfast, though it could be multi-storey. The term can also be used for small hotels, especially in the Japanese countryside.\nSudomari 素泊まり — Stay without meals at a reduced price for pilgrims. When making a booking, you can also say: ‘Sudomari onegaishimasu’ to make it clear that you only want a room and no meals.\n 4. Henro Lodging List (Updated 2019) Henro hut #51 close to Temple #82.\nThe people who walk the henro are diverse. Some are city dwellers who have only ever slept in the comforts of home and hotels. Others are free spirits who have trekked the Himalayas. After a few years of feedback from readers and fellow henro, I am adding a bit more context to my information to help you better decide what works for you.\nAlso, I suggest checking out this useful map from JPilgrim.\nThis list is available as:\n Google Doc Downloadable PDF  Please note this list has not been updated since 2019 and is not actively maintained.\nSome Notes of the Entries in this List My list comes from English, Japanese, and Chinese sources. The information ranges from 2010-2016. After 2015, more henro huts were being built (at least 55 now). I have not physically verified all of these places and cannot verify their state now, but I have made an effort to add updates sent by other pilgrims. The JPilgrim map seems the most updated. Please try to verify and exchange information with other henro when you start walking.\nI have translated Japanese \u0026amp; Chinese information into English. English-only entries below mean that they were not on my Japanese nojuku sheets.\nTry searching for Couchsurfing and AirBnB hosts as well. There are more AirBnB listings now than when I was walking and they may be good options.\nPlaces I’ve stayed are in bold. Where possible, I have left comments to give further information as I am a shoestring backpacker. I care about cleanliness more than comfort and power outlets are an optional luxury to me as I didn’t need a smartphone all the time.\nClosed locations are on this list, but they are crossed out. I kept the listings in case people have old lists and it is clear that they were not missing from this list, but rather that you should not go to them.\nAgain, a gentle reminder from local ryokan owners: There have been cases of no-show amongst foreign walking henro. If you decide not to stay, please notify the ryokan and say:\n Moshimoshi. Sumimasen. [Your name] desu. Yoyaku kanseru kudasai.’ Kanseru = cancel.\n Giving notice if you cannot arrive is basic guest etiquette. I have known of ryokan owners who stay up waiting for their guest to arrive / return. They need to specially prepare your meal for you, so providing notice is out of consideration for their preparation. Your cooperation will help future henro by keeping ryokan doors open to foreign guests. Thanks again!\n 5. Additional Sources If you’re confident about your smartphone, then I recommend you use the JPilgrim (2016) as it’s the most visually appealing and has complete information that’s the most updated I know of.

The same principle is true for the Shikoku Pilgrimage. This post breaks down the cost of my 40-day walking trip into daily expenses. I explain section by section why the costs were that way so that you can see what options are available to you. This is a shoestring budget, so a more accurate budget should be around US$3000 for the trip itself (not including airfare).\nDaily Breakdown  Accommodation / Lodgings Transportation Wifi Food Activities \u0026amp; Temple Visits Miscellaneous Additional Costs  My Shikoku Pilgrimage Cost Breakdown Henro at a temple\nTotal Trip Cost: ¥174,399 / US$1402 I arrived in Japan about a month before I started the pilgrimage and volunteered on organic farms. After the pilgrimage, I stayed to travel other parts of Japan and moved to Tokyo. For this reason, some of my transit costs for getting to/from Shikoku may not accurately reflect the cost of most one-off trips. For most people, the flights and accommodation will be the two most expensive items. My trip cost is on the extremely low end because I chose to do mostly nojuku, camping and was happy to live off of onigiri (rice balls). I think a less budget-conscious approach will do a lot to help you enjoy your trip a lot more.\n1. Accommodation: ¥40,565 / US$325 AirBnB in Kochi City\nI did a mixed approach for my accommodations. Wherever I could, I did nojuku, which means I slept outdoors. I also stayed at dedicated henro huts or at temple tsuyado, *zenkonyado *run by Shikoku pilgrim supporters, hostels, and cheap AirBnBs. I also stayed in a few hotels, ryokans, and minshukus. My trip breakdown was as follows:\n¥3000+: 9 days ¥1000-2000: 6 days Free: 25 days\nI feel like doing it all without any paid accommodation is a stretch and treating ourselves once in a while is both physically and emotionally restorative. I do think it is possible to do mostly ¥1000-2000 minshuku and *ryokan-*only stays if you pace yourself and plan your route well. For most of my stays, except for the hotel I arrived at like a drowned duck, I opted for sudomari, which means a stay with no meals, which saves some money. Typically, *ryokan * and minshuku prices given include at least one meal (dinner or breakfast the next morning).\n2. Transportation: ¥34,600 / US$278 Taking the ferry across Uranouchi Bay, Kochi Prefecture\nTransportation should be broken down into two parts: getting to Shikoku and getting around Shikoku. I took a charter flight from Asia, so I’m not including it here because most readers I assume will be flying from places like the US and Europe.\nGetting to Shikoku for me:\nTransportation comes in two sections: getting to Shikoku and getting around Shikoku. I took a charter flight from Asia, so I’m not including it here mostly because it might give you the wrong impression.\nGetting to Shikoku includes:\n Airfare to and from Japan (I think I flew to Kyoto for my volunteering first) Getting from the airport to Shikoku: Coach bus from Kyoto to Tokushima Leaving Shikoku: 14-day JR Pass activated to leave Shikoku and travel the rest of the country (~US$300) Optional: Going to and from Mount Koya (see notes below)  Getting around Shikoku for me included trains and buses because I walked around 900/1200 km of the trip. You can see from my daily transportation column that many rides will be around ¥1000 each ride because even the buses are going between towns. I took a mix of buses and trains in order to make my schedule and also because I sprained my ankle badly in a remote area. For the train, you can use Google Maps, which will not only show you the train schedule, but also the ticket price. Google will not show you private bus lines on Shikoku, but you can get pretty close to every temple with a bus.\nOptional trip to Mount Koya: \u0026gt;US$ 150 I went to Mount Koya as a separate trip from Tokyo, not from Shikoku directly. By then, I was living in Tokyo and I did the trip in the absolute cheapest way possible (which means you should expect to spend a bit more than this). I took an overnight bus, stayed one night, hiked up the Koyasan Choishi Pilgrimage Trail, went through Mount Koya, and came right down to take the overnight bus back.\nMy costs included:\n ~US$60: Overnight bus Tokyo – Osaka. They are called 高速バス・夜行バス) ~US$50: AirBnB ~US$50: Train to Kudayama \u0026amp; Tram down from Osaka  I didn’t keep the receipts for this trip. I absolutely recommend staying overnight at Mount Koya, which is easily another US$100 depending on where you stay. There is only one budget guest house as far as I know. I didn’t have the option because I needed to catch a flight, but I would have loved to enjoy the grounds for longer.\n3. Wifi: ¥0 I did not pay for a SIM card or data for my trip because I was fine with using an offline map (Maps.me) and relying on convenience store WiFi only (from Family Mart and Lawson). You can go to my cost considerations post to learn more about WiFi options.\nMy rationale was that I was camping, so my phone would be dead half the time. Also, I was looking forward to the digital detox. Finally, the route is basically a circle around an island, so I was pretty confident that I could navigate by doing the old-fashioned sign reading and tracking the sun’s position. The next time I go back, I will probably get a data SIM because it’s good value for having a backup, but I am still satisfied with my offline approach.\n4. Food: ¥39,240 / US$315 I didn’t have a job at the time, so I was spending as little as possible. I averaged less than ¥2000 / US$20 per day and sometimes went under ¥1000 / US$10. I optimised calories per dollar. That meant that in addition to living off of onigiri (rice balls), I went after snacks like chips and meal replacements that were light, dry, easy to carry, and high in calories. I wanted calories because I needed them for the amount I was walking and if I was camping, I did not pass a convenience store or restaurant every day. I was walking in the summer, so it was so hot that I usually lost my appetite. By the end of the trip, my shorts were too big for me and my waistline has never returned to its former girth. My piece of advice is to factor in at least 10-20% more in your budget for food in the winter. The seasons affect your food budget when you are outdoors. It is natural for your body to want more food when it is cold.\n5. Activities / Temple Visits / Gear: ¥39,014 / US$ 314 Activities means mostly temple stamps. They are usually ¥300 per stamp, so that means ¥300 * 88 = ¥26,400 / US$250, which is no small investment. The other activities I remember include going to the onsen, which I did whenever I could because I wanted to clean up and soak my muscles — one of the small luxuries I afforded myself.\nThe other part may have been the gear. I didn’t buy much henro gear. I got the staff at Temple #1 (and instantly regretted it when I saw how many beautiful free ones were left at Temple #2), a bell because I like them and they have a practical use for warding off bears and giving people a heads up. I also got a sedge hat after reading from other henro that it was useful — and it is. I swear by my sedge hat which did more for me in the sun and rain than my jackets and umbrellas could. I also bought the incense sticks. I think two boxes got me through the whole trip with most of the second one left over.\n**I think it is important to be considered about why you are getting pilgrimage gear. **I am also a layperson doing the pilgrimage, and my trip is only possible through the goodwill of the many locals who support me (from osettai gifts to just being friendly with directions). This goodwill, in many respects, is due to locals supporting the people whom they trust to be doing a walk as part of their faith. While many are aware that foreign visitors are doing the pilgrimage out of cultural interest, we should be mindful that we are guests under the auspices of the locals. This is all to say, irrespective of our faith, or lack thereof, the Shikoku Pilgrimage is a religious pilgrimage, and specifically Buddhist pilgrimage. I don’t think there is a correct answer as to whether to get all the pilgrimage gear or not. I personally did not, based on my specific understanding of the Buddhist text I have studied. Though I lean towards suggesting not getting items unless you have a specific reason to, especially to reduce consumerism, it is up to each person to decide how best to respect the host region and its peoples.\n6. Miscellaneous / Laundry / Emergencies: ¥21,080 / US$ 169 I think one of the big miscellaneous items was actually a new pair of runners because the sole of my (already old) runners came off. I had super glued them back together a few times, which gave them an extra week until I made it to Matsuyama. I think that costed at least US$80.\nThe other thing I suggest people factor in is money for laundry. One important thing to factor in are rest day because that is when you can do your laundry, take care of errands and life admin, or just rest your muscles and joints.\n7. Additional Costs Trip gear\nNote that this daily budget sheet did not include the trip gear that I previously had. The major investment that I made was for a sleeping bag (approx US$100) and tent (approx US$100). I did not get any other specific equipment for the trip because I wore my runners, sports clothes, and day backpack from my other trips. Investing in better equipment, such as lightweight hiking clothing, can make your trip a lot easier. Your trip equipment can be a significant investment if you do not already regularly hike or backpack. You can check my cost considerations and packing list for more information.\nA note about visas\nMy trip did not require a visa, which of course saves money. I believe US, Australian, and EU citizens can go to Japan without a visa. I know Chinese nationals need a visa, so I imagine visitors from other countries may also need to check those regulations as well.\nSouvenirs\nI think this went into my miscellaneous section. I bought charms for friends as souvenirs when I found one that I liked, had something that was meaningful, and knew that person would like. I think temple charms are about the best souvenirs to give, and more distinct than the stuff you will get in Osaka or Tokyo.\n You can see a clearer Google Spreadsheet by clicking here.\n   Exchange to HKD Exchange to USD Expenses: 40-day Shikoku Pilgrimage Cost Breakdown (June - August 2015)           16.05 124.42 PRICES IN JAPANESE YEN (JPY)**** US$1 = 124.42 YEN / HK$1 = 16.05 YEN*****         Date Day Lodging Food Activities Transp.

After it dies down, I roll over and push myself up groggily. I pack my bag and put the futon back onto a stack in the corner. There are only the items I’m mailing left out on the floor, and the nokyocho that I’m leaving for the Mizutanis. It’s the only gesture of thanks I can give.\nI go to the kitchen to find it empty. Oh no. The noise that woke me was Masashi heading to work. I missed saying goodbye by a few minutes.\nI can’t take that back. Then, another immediate concern pops up: satisfying my stomach which woke me up. After I’ve snacked a bit, Ayumi emerges from the bedroom and asks me if I’ve eaten breakfast. She gets me more food before sitting down to do her Spanish homework. Kotaro is napping, so it is unusually quiet: one of those precious moments of alone time for her.\nWe chat as I wait for the post office to open to mail off some extra items to Tokyo. Ayumi tells me stories behind all the Couchsurfing photos on wall. She also shows me the remaining photos of her trip to South America with Masashi. When they had three months between university graduation and their secured jobs, they wanted to take the opportunity to travel, to go where they would have no chance to go again after joining the Japanese workforce.\nThe early morning passes quickly until I head out to the post office. It’s a quick walk down the street, and I pay the ¥1000 to mail a box of newly deemed unessentials to Tokyo. I wish I had more things to fit in apart from a water bottle, my maps from yesterday, and a jacket won’t need in the summer heat. None of those items weigh much, but I’ve realised I need to shave even 500 grams and I don’t want to throw anything out. It’s an investment to help me see this pilgrimage through.\nI head back down the street to grab a coffee and already feel lighter, mentally, for shedding a bit more. When I arrive back in the flat, I rush to grab my stuff to catch the 10:30am train. Ayumi and Kotaro head out with me and I anxiously say goodbye as we turn different directions.\nIf I miss this train to Awa-Fukui, I’ll have to wait two hours, or might as well walk. It’s only a few stops away, but it makes up for the lost hours waiting for the post office to open.\nWhen I arrive at the platform with a few minutes to spare, I feel bad about rushing off and not saying a better goodbye. I’m always so awkward with goodbyes. So instead, I watch the group of young students in matching hats on the platform with three teachers shepherding them. Their bubbly energy is infectious, and I can’t help but smile as I get into the train after them.\n It’s my first long walk through the middle of nowhere. Within minutes of getting off the train, I’m following the only road going south to Hiwasa and Temple 23. There’s only mountain, blue sky, and tunnels. I keep checking the map, but it only confirms how slow I am. I try to walk faster, especially with the weight of my backpack still bothering me.\nI hate speed walking. It tenses my muscles unnaturally as I try to urge them faster. If I didn’t have a backpack, I’d just start jogging. The past two days have really dented my confidence in how much I can walk. My feet are already hurting by the second hour. How do people regularly average 30 kilometres a day? Maybe I’m just naturally weak and I just need to accept it.\nThese thoughts don’t dampen my good mood. It’s refreshing to be in these hills again. I like the hollow thud of my staff, especially in the tunnels, where the strikes reverberate as declarations. I love the bell I’ve tied to the staff, which has a predictable jiggle based on how I move. I love how I have time to notice all these things.\nI love how I have time to think, to let my thoughts float. I think again about Ayumi, who finished the pilgrimage in just over two weeks without prior cycling training. Despite her amazing accomplishment, she was concerned about me camping in the mountains as I did Kakurin-ji and Tairyuu-ji in a day. I wonder if I’ll ever have the same genuine concern for another pilgrim or offer them the comfort that the Mizutanis offered me in place of a lonely ordeal in the forest mountains.\nI wonder again if there’s still any meaning in this after I’ve taken so many rides. I can’t say I walked the entire pilgrimage. Perhaps I give up too easily. I had no reason to take a train today, other than wanting to guarantee that I could make it to the next temple before 5pm.\nMy thoughts continue circling. Eventually, I think about other people: high school friends, university friends, Hong Kong friends, employers, team members, family. My thoughts latch on to the people I haven’t seen, haven’t talked to, don’t want to talk to, or am unsure if I want to see. They’re the people I wish I was closer to. I wonder how they are. I wonder what they’re like now.\nI flip between my mental landscape and the landscape around me all day. The scenery changes in 15-minute intervals: rest huts, streams, insects, birds chirping, the bamboo water wheel fountain that someone has set up.\nEven though it’s only 2pm by the time I begin seeing a splatter of shops going into Hiwasa, my feet are beginning to ache. It’s a good walking day, but it’s still hot.\nI reach a Lawson at the edge of town at 3:30pm and have a late lunch out on the parking lot, gulping down a full yogurt drink and devouring a pineapple bun. Even though my feet have been suffocated in my running shoes, I get up again eagerly to get to Yakuo-ji, just another 15 minutes away.\nBy 4:00pm, I am standing at the highest point of the Temple 23 complex, surveying the city of Hiwasa facing the Pacific and the cute island-rock just off the shore. The breeze, thick with the salt of the sea, wipes the sweat off my face and soaked back.\nI wait for this moment of satisfaction, of stillness after finishing for the day, to pass. I think about a family friend I grew up with. He came to our family dinners so often he feels closer than any of my cousins. He entertained all my insistent ideas and games. He still wears the same smile he did two decades ago despite a challenging past two years. I don’t know what goes on in his head. I never have even though we grew up together. I doubt he gets me either, but that makes him feel more like family. After moving so much, I have a newfound appreciation for people who have known you since the early days and are still around. Yakuou-ji is for him and his mother. He’s a pharmacist.\n What’s there to do in a small city after the temple visitation is done? Clean up! Seeing an onsen on the map, I realise it’s a chance at a bath, since I will be doing nojuku, camping out, for the first time. A good scrub, warm jets for weary muscles, and clean clothes (there’s a coin laundry!) is too much to resist.\nI end up spending close to two hours here, waiting for my clothes, napping, and charging my phone. I’m also reluctant to leave this sanctuary and venture back out into the hot and humid night. I couldn’t find the legendary refurbished-bus zenkonyado that’s reportedly 1-2km outside the temple. Zenkonyado are of free/cheap henro accommodations maintained by individuals supporting walking henro. I would find out over years later that the Hashimoto bus was closed and the henro grapevine has a string of complaints of harassment from women, though men give raving reviews.\nThe bus was my real destination. I still need to find a place to sleep every day, and tonight I’ve failed. What should I do now that night has set in?\nAs I reluctantly put on my shoes to head out, two chatting ojii-san (grandpas) ask me the usual questions. Where am I from, how long am I walking for, am I really alone?\nEventually, they ask, ‘So where are you staying tonight?’\n‘Nojuku.’ I answer. Camping.\nThey’re shocked, then concerned. One of them hangs around to continue chatting, although I can barely understand his thick accent.\nWe stand at the parking lot outside the onsen trying to make sense of each other. He says it’s abunai (dangerous), and that he’s shinpai (worried). I get snippets about his son, who has a house and a family, and someone (him? his son?) has a spare room.\nI politely decline, saying I’m fine to stay at the Michi-no-Eki (roadside station) just down the road. We debate further. Eventually, he tells me that he can drive me where I want. Not wanting to reject his earnestness, I relent.\nWhen I open his car door, I see the heap of cans (and other things) that spilled from the back seats into the front passenger seat. And the smell! He quickly reaches over to clear space for me, but I’m tempted to just walk away.\nNot wanting to hurt his feelings, I finally get in after insisting that he take me down the block. He is visibly disappointed and doesn’t stop after looping through the dark Michi-no-Eki parking lot with the single remaining shop open. Instead, he drives further down the road and shows me another spot behind a white building that he says is better because the traffic cannot see me.\nNo thanks. I ask him to drive me back, and get out as fast as possible, thanking him nonetheless for the ride. Maybe he really was well meaning, but the car was unsettling.\nWhen he’s gone, I go across the street to get onigiri (rice balls) at the convenience store. I’m not hungry, but I should eat.\nWhen I finish, I go back to the Michi-no-Eki and look for the a place to sleep. The benches look comfortable, but as the ojii-san said, a bit too exposed. Instead, I walk into the handicap toilet, because the floor is spacious enough to sleep on. The thing about Japanese toilets is they’re usually very clean, and this one is no exception. In fact, it even has a pull-out bed! There’s even an outlet. Score!\nThe only minus is the mosquitos lining the walls. I do a mental shrug. You take what you get.\nIt feels early, only 8pm, but I might as well tuck in. Henro have early days and nights.\nI lock the door and make this my room for the night.\n"});index.add({'id':11,'href':'/book/docs/Diary-Entries/day-6/','title':"Day 6 - June 26",'section':"Diary Entries",'content':"=====\nHiwasa City 日和佐市 → Shishikui 宍喰\nTemples: None.\nWeather: Heavy Rain. Light Rain.\nTravel Method: Train\nDistance: (+14) 17.7 km\n=====\nThe sound of droplets wash away the haze of sleep. There’s something soothing about waking to the sound of rain. It was too hot to sleep well last night, and I eventually dozed off as light seeped in from the upper window. It was my first time doing nojuku (‘camping’ out), and this wheelchair accessible toilet at the Hiwasa Michi-no-Eki was entirely improvised. Even as I lay awake, sweating in my sleeping bag, I was grateful to have a bed in a clean, private space. I’m grateful that I didn’t have too many of the mosquitos hovering around my ear even though hundreds of them lined the walls.\nI clean up quickly, pack up and unlock the washroom door at 6:30am. The door slides open to a grand downpour outside.\nThis rain: should I persist and walk? I didn’t want to. This weather’s got it decided. I’m at a train station. I just have to hop on the next train.\nI sit on the bench outside and eat my onigiri from last night for breakfast, watching the rain splinter like liquid diamonds on the pavement. On the wall behind me, there’s a sticker saying free WiFi. What? Score!\nMy wait for the 7:21am train flies by as I upload a photo of my sleeping quarters from last night onto Facebook and reconnect with friends, with my fully charged phone thanks to last night’s outlet. It’s a great morning so far.\nI’m at home in the rain, and it’s refreshing in the summer heat. I could walk in this if only I had a warm shelter and a hot drink at the end of the day. Hiwasa is the last ‘city’ on the pilgrimage until Kochi, which is over two hundred kilometres away. The next temple is 75 kilometres away at Cape Muroto and many pilgrims describe this as a desolate coastline. I try to figure out a reasonable place to stop tonight. There are rest huts, bus stops, tsunami shelters, and a Daishido in the tiny towns of Kaifu, Toyo, and Sakibama along the coast. Will I be able to find them, or will it be like last night, where I failed to find my bus shelter?\nIn this rain, my Gore-tex rain jacket and folding umbrella won’t keep me dry. My backpack doesn’t have a waterproof cover. Also, the sole of my left runner is coming off. Part of me still wants to walk, despite the stacked odds.\nI smile at the literal manifestation of: ’when it rains, it pours’. Although I am still officially in Tokushima Prefecture, the Dojo of Awakening ended yesterday at Temple 23. From here, the Dojo of Discipline begins the long, arduous, forsaken road to Temple 24.\nAyumi had described this stretch of coastline as scary and lonely. ‘It has nothing!’ She exclaimed emphatically. To her, it was even worse than the 80 kilometres between Temples 37 and 38 in Kochi Prefecture, which is the longest distance between temples in the entire pilgrimage.\nI try to find accommodation on AirBnB in the towns ahead. There aren’t many in my budget for emergency lodgings. It’s not ideal, but I book one instant booking anyway, hoping that once I get to the town of Shishikui, I’ll find Wifi again to receive a confirmation.\nFor now, onwards. The first train of the day will soon be here.\nThe train comes on the other side of the tracks, and I’m drenched just climbing the overpass to get to the platform. Still, I’m happy because I have a plan. I feel lucky to have seen the sticker, to have woken up naturally to catch the first train, to be able to look out the window at the landscape outside. In this ‘horrible’ weather, I feel lucky.\nThere’s a cafe on the side of the Route 55 that looks like one of those drive-bys or outpost shops back from the settler days of the New World. It looks like a good shelter for a watery Armageddon. At 8:30am, there is already the warm glow of yellow lamps and a small gathering of patrons lined at the bar. I came to Shishikui for this cafe because it’s been mentioned in several henro lists. When the lady inside saw me peeking in through the misty windows, she raced outside to the entrance to greet me.\nCafe Hikousen provides coffee o-settai, for henro. A henro should not refuse, as the offer is in part to Kobo Daishi, who is believed to accompany all henro. Even though I’d kill for a cup of coffee right now, it felt awkward requesting a complimentary gift.\n‘O-henro-san!’ The lady calls from the covered entrance. ‘Please come in!’ She shouts to make sure I hear her over the rain.\nI’m relieved and follow her in. Immediately, the aroma of coffee blankets me. I can’t shed my dripping jacket fast enough, and place it in the corner with my backpack. They form a pool at the door in minutes. The lady asks if I’m OK with it being at the entrance, mindful that I might be worried about my belongings.\nJapan’s one of the safest countries I’ve been in, and many of my hosts never even locked their doors. I can’t imagine why anyone would want to take my drenched belongings. ‘It’s fine,’ I cheerfully respond. They beckon me to the bar counter and comment about the rain, and how dreadful the rain is.\nI feel like I’ve walked into the Jazz den with solid wood interior, fresh stubs on ashtrays. The booth tables under the windows have stained-glass Tiffany Lamps. The bar has seating for about 5-6 people. There’s a stocky lady with an unreadable expression chatting with guests as she brews their coffees. The ladies ask me if I’d like a coffee, and then ask me to pick from the array of cups behind them. Then, they ask me if I’ve had breakfast yet. The onigiri is almost fully digested, so I hesitantly say, ‘A little, earlier.’\n‘Can you eat another?’ The thin lady forms a plate with her hands. ‘It’s quite big…’\n‘It’s fine.’ (As in, yes, I think I can handle it.) I apologise and thank them, ‘Sumimasen.’\nThere’s something in that simple ‘Excuse me’ and bow that reflects how I feel when receiving favours. An English ‘Thank you’ doesn’t do it, and even the two Cantonese thank-yous (general, and for gifts) doesn’t convey the emotive intonation.\nThe coffee comes first. Then, a slice of watermelon and two kai, the fresh local sea snails come on a plate. Then, they place an omelette, a salad, and potatoes slightly to my side. Then, three thick slices of toast with butter and red-bean paste. At first I don’t dare to presume it’s for me and leave the spread. The o-settai was supposed to be just coffee, and I already got the kai. Eventually, I ask, ‘Is this really for me?’\n‘Yes, please eat!’\nI do my best not to devour it. I savour every item, asking about it, how it’s made, and the history of the place in my broken Japanese. The gentleman beside me strikes up conversation, and soon everything I say travels down the bar, seat by seat.\nIt turns out, the cup I’m drinking from is made by the silver-bearded gentleman on the other end. I read the catalogues about his work, which has an English description, and am impressed by his philosophical approach to his products. Suddenly, the cup I’m drinking from has so much more significance, and I appreciate the technique behind the handle so much better. The master artist, Umeda Junichi, who has regular displays across the country, comes over to have a chat.\nSuddenly, this little cafe seems to have room enough for all the world to come. What other world-class things does this little town keep hidden?\nIf it wasn’t pouring, I wouldn’t have met all these people. I ask for another coffee, hoping to make a small purchase in return for their generosity. I’m looking forward to staying for a few more hours, maybe even get a blog post in, until my AirBnB host confirms my stay.\nThat plan soon goes out the window. A group of people come in, and there’s a flurry of greetings. I spot a Caucasian lady with a shaved head. She seems really happy to see me, so I instinctively say, ‘Hey!’ and we hug each other on the spot, like long-lost friends.\nI think it’s the first time I’ve ever hugged a stranger like a lost friend.\nInstantly, we start chatting. It turns out that Aurelie has come from France to walk the pilgrimage, even though she had little solo travel experience. She tells me about how she made it to Temple 29 in Kochi before the incessant rain drove her to return to Shishikui, where she’d met a good friend. She’s been here for three weeks. She then tells me about this town’s warmth, of the surfing, the music gigs, of WWOOFing at the Tanakas’, the young couple that came in with her. We share experiences on the road, laugh at shared preoccupations, obsessions, and despairs.\nEventually, she says, ‘I think I’m ready to start again.’\nBefore long, another plate of toast is placed between us, this time with herbed bread and melted cheese. I can’t finish. It’s really too much. Then, another full bowl of kai, is slipped in. Why are people so generous?\nSomewhere in between, Umeda-san takes his leave and pointing to us, cries to the owner, ‘O-settai!’ He probably has a regular tab with them. Shouldn’t it be the other way around? Maybe this is just the pilgrimage microcosm: the world turned upside down in a too-good-to-believe way.\nThen, Aurelie offers me a place to stay. She asks the Tanakas whether I can stay one night. They happily agree, and I cancel my still-unconfirmed AirBnB booking, take a group photo with my new friends and the cafe owner, we all head out to the car.\nI quickly type a note: *There are so many reasons to love the rain. It makes the world so warm. * By 2pm, I’m hanging out in a house handmade by a carpenter. The place smells like the cabins in my outdoor-school trip in Grade 7 on Canada’s West Coast. It’s a distinctly smoky cedar smell. The wooden logs are perfectly sanded. The kitchen area has a round opening cut out through the log wall. A few sets of cups and plates reflecting the tastes of the owner are neatly displayed in the back shelf. The table in the common area is simple, solid hardwood. Logs make up chairs looking out the windows.\nTo think that such gorgeous places just exist, without being intentionally designed for commercial tourism purposes…\nThe hand-built cabin that will become a community space. The carpenter who built this place died while making the house, and his wife after years of grief walked the Shikoku Pilgrimage and returned a changed person. The Tanakas, who found this place for Aurelie to stay, are helping convert it into a community building. The husband, Munetoyo, is an ex-professional surfer and custom surfboard maker. In addition, he and his wife, Miko, just began accepting volunteers to help on their organic gardens.\nAfter leaving Cafe Hikousen, Miko made us a hearty udon lunch, insisting that I just chat with Aurelie. Miko doesn’t speak English, and Aurlie knows single Japanese words, so they get by using gestures.\nMiko repeated something Aurelie said earlier at the cafe: Your eyes communicate your feeling. Her eyes welled up when she said it.\nAfter lunch, she made us fresh scones as an afternoon snack. Hoping to burn some energy and repay her generosity, I ask if she needs any help in the garden, but she rejects my suggestions saying we should rest. Eventually, I accept the imposed holiday, even though I haven’t worked much since setting out three days ago.\nAt the carpenter’s house, I spread out my belongings which are damp from the morning rain. When you have so few possessions to get you from day to day, you make sure everything will be in order for the next day’s walking. In this case, it means drying them.\nAurelie has the Japanese list of free henro lodging that I had lost the day before. We trade tips, since she had walked to Temple 29 and has lodging recommendations. I translate the Japanese words for her. We compare the same Shikoku Japan 88 Route Guide Book, hers marked up with notes like a diary, mine with phone numbers and sleeping options.\nShe feels ready to start again, maybe by next Monday. Wouldn’t it be great to go together? I think so as well. Having one extra person will be more relaxing, especially at night. It’ll be perfect for the final stretch to Cape Ashizuri and Temple 37, the furthest temple.\nAfter a bit more chatting and a smoke, Aurelie takes a nap and I use the precious hours to type up notes. It’s the perfect writer’s room, facing the trees outside. In about two hours, we’ll go to the onsen.\nI begin to take notes of today, making a list decorated only by their time markers:\n 6:00am wake up— wow there’s wifi!! 7:21 train 8:23 arrive in shishikui 8:57 get first food in hikousen – watermelon and a local sea snail 9:00 coffee, meet artist, massive breakfast with salad, omelette, toast 10 – more toast – with cheese and herbs, more shellfish 11:30 leave with the tanakas 12:20 lunch udon 13:50 hang out at cabin with scones\n They will serve as reminders in the future when I want to relive these moments and feelings. Some of it I’d written since the morning, on my Journey app.\n However you choose to get through it, all you need to do is complete it. How you do the pilgrimage is a reflection of your life – how you get help from others, how you ask, how you don’t, how far you go.\n Eventually, I stop even narrating and just write down the solitary declarations.\nSometimes, the more profound the learnings the less you have to say. You’ve soaked it in to be a part of you. How do you isolate and describe that?\nI won’t try today.\nWith that, I stop, and go outside to clean up the Tanakas’ bike, which they’ve kept for memory’s sake. Munetoyo had borrowed it from Miko through a friend, and the rest of their love story is history. With such significance behind this weathered iron horse, it makes my hobby of bike-chain cleaning twice as rewarding.\nWhen Aurelie wakes up, we walk out to the Shishikui Onsen, which is actually in a hotel facing the sea. The storm has passed, but the sky is still unfolding in broad brushstrokes of metallic silver, grey, and searing white. The sea sunsets after a storm are always particularly vigorous.\nWe pass about two hours at the onsen, soaking in the pools and lounging in the rest areas, me using the Wifi to check up on weather updates and bus times. By the time we exit, it’s dark, and I can feel the curtain coming down on an effortlessly eventful day. Aurelie makes dinner for us and after, we finalise our meet up date and location, at Temple 37 just outside Kochi City and before the routes split to go down to Temple 38 at Cape Ashizuri.\nPart of me doesn’t want to go. I want to continue relishing this cabin.\n‘I don’t really want to leave tomorrow. I don’t feel I’m done here,’ I sigh, not for the first time today.\n‘Then stay,’ Aurelie says simply. It’s true. It’s a simple choice.\nIt could easily be complicated by many other factors and considerations. In that moment, it boiled down to two principles: whether I would make it a leisure trip and enjoy everything until I was ready to move on, or whether it was a journey about continually moving on and enjoying things as they came and went. As hard as it was, I wanted to move on. If it’s meant to be, I will be back.\nThe last thing I do before passing out is type 22:00 – sleep.\n"});index.add({'id':12,'href':'/book/docs/Diary-Entries/day-7/','title':"Day 7 - June 27",'section':"Diary Entries",'content':"=====\nShishikui 宍喰 → Kiragawa 吉良川\nTemples: 24 Hotsumisaki-ji (最御崎寺), 25 Shinshō-ji (津照寺), 26 Kongōchō-ji (金剛頂寺)\nWeather: Cloudy + Rain\nTravel Method: Bus + Walking\nDistance: (+40) 27 km\n=====\nMorning. Fold futon. Open curtains. Sunshine. It rained. Pack. Eat.\nI move around as quietly as I can. Aurelie is still sleeping, and I enjoy extending morning quiet before the day begins.\nAt some point, something clatters and I hear Aurelie wake. Still, it doesn’t break my contented silence. That this may be rude drifts into my thoughts. I let the idea drift off. I prepare a light breakfast of leftover mashed potatoes from yesterday. I may as well have coffee and tea and sit by the window watching the golden slight flicker up the trees. Who knows when I will have such a luxury again. I’m keenly aware of every comfort I’m losing along the way.\nAurelie come out and has a smoke. After waiting as I linger over breakfast, she eventually she asks gently, ‘Do you mind if I go ahead?’ There was the implicit assumption that we were going to head out together, but I am glad for the chance to say goodbye to this place alone.\nAfter she goes, I unwrap my feelings. I want to cocoon here. This place makes me feel like there’s something that I’m missing, something from the West Coast and my childhood that I’ve forgotten. Since coming to Asia, I’ve had an increasing ache for the British Columbia’s temperate rainforest. This place across the Pacific is so much like home.\nI have to move on to meet Aurelie next week at Temple 35, as we agreed. I’m glad we made that promise, otherwise I might be lulled to stay. I can’t stay. I’ve only just started.\nDespite downsizing my luggage, I’ve kept a small tea cup, a sentimental talisman to keep a sense of who I am in anticipation of all the extra parts of me that will be parred away. This morning deserves a nice tea cup.\nTime slips by too quickly. Before I know it, I’m rushing to write down a thank-you card for the Tanakas, a postcard for Aurelie, and an osamefuda, nameslip, which henros give when they receive o-settai. I prepare one for Cafe Hikousen that I can drop off on the way out of town.\nWith everything tidied up, I rush out the and through Shishikui. I stop outside Cafe Hikousen to check some WiFi updates before going in to give them the osamefuda, but the owner from yesterday races out to offer another coffee. I apologise for not being able to stay, as I have to rush to catch the bus in the next town at Kannoura. That bus will take me down the coast to Cape Muroto. I have time for coffee, but not to chat, and don’t want to impose more on their generosity.\nSo instead, the owner sends me off with a big hug. Not being used to them, it took me a second before reciprocating her tight embrace. The warmth conveyed by those arms say more than any words we could ever muster. Who said the Japanese were cold?\nI think of Aurelie. She said yesterday that she felt so isolated at times, without company, unable to communicate in a foreign country, and missing the warm hugs she had back home. I want to tell her: ‘When you start again, stop by Hikousen for a hug!’, but it’ll have to wait for later. But in reality, her departure from this town could never be like mine.\n Relief. I arrive at Kannoura Bus Station with 15 minutes to spare. I feel a bit silly for jogging some parts and worrying when I got lost in the tiny town. Then again, you never know how far something really is until you’ve done the route. In rural areas like this, missing a bus can mean a several-hour wait, and I’m itching for a good walk today after I get off the bus (which I am taking because none of the places to camp are in feasible distances).\nWhy am I still doing this? The sky is grey. I have the full rainy season and scorching summer ahead. I’m not a Buddhist. I’m a borderline cynic. But you have to believe in something to put yourself through this ridiculousness. I don’t know what it is, but I know that there is something bigger than my list of reasons. I know I wanted to do it.\nA thought from yesterday returns to me: Whatever you believe, you must believe in something to do the Ohenro.\nMaybe someday, I’ll figure out what it is.\nThe bus comes and whisks me forty kilometres down the desolate, still grey and rugged, coast that I decided not to walk. I’m writing off this first leg. Even though I’ve had some challenges since starting, I feel like I’ve gotten off easy. Three of my four days so far have been in comfortable homes, with real food, nothing like the pilgrimage I’d expected. Maybe they’re meant to ease me into the weight of walking and the inconveniences of the weather.\nPerhaps if I’d prepared better, had more time, come the right reason, I’d have managed it all walking. Next time I do this, I’ll do better. Typical, I think detachedly. I rarely get things right the first time; I always need a second chance. Mental shrug.\nBut I will walk the full length of Kochi. If I can’t do it all properly, then I am going to do the most difficult prefecture. Kochi, formerly the Kingdom of Tosa, stretches over 250 kilometres from Cape Muroto in the East to Cape Ashizuri in the Southwest. It is a rugged place, where the dark, fierce sea and the ragged mountains still govern human lives. I’ve read that here, henro are exposed to the weather, relentless sun and torrential rain. I will use this formidable reputation as a yardstick. I’m looking forward to the challenge, to the opportunity to prove myself.\nMy bus comes and whisks me down along the sea. I look out the window at the severe, jagged rocks and ferocious waves raging at them set against a sombre sky. I am struck by how insane, trivial, futile, egotistical, myopic, delusional, and yet, human, this seems. I type on my (charged!) phone:\n What crazy people think that by walking thousands of miles away from home could bring good will to those who need it? Such is the mystery and logic of humanity.\n I smile and shake my head at myself. I’ve joined the crazies. The one kilometre climb from the bus stop up to Hotsumisaki-ji is an easy one. The plants here are subtropical, leafy and curvy, a contrast from the tall evergreen forests of Tokushima. The mosquitoes remain the same.\nThis temple has great significance to henro as the place where Kobo Daishi came to do ascetic training at the age of 19, and returned to at the age of 33 to establish the temple. This cape has other areas of interests too, such as the geological formations from 100 million years ago, the cave Kobo Daishi meditated at and a lighthouse.\nI don’t have time for the first two, but after temple dedications, I head to the lighthouse to take a photo for the friend I’d dedicated them to. She loves the sea, and there are only a handful of temples on the route that are beside the coast. Kochi’s two capes have significance to a walking henro because they are both lonely, multi-day walks. It’s one thing to walk 80+ kilometres to pray for yourself. It’s quite another to walk for someone else. When my friend found out about the torrential rains, she told me to be pragmatic. But friendships aren’t built on pragmatism, often quite the opposite. And they are cemented appreciation and reciprocation of the same. How different this walk would have been even a few years ago, before smartphones and Wi-Fi were ubiquitous. Even though I spend hours or days without connecting, the dribble of close friends like her every now and then is a lifeline.\nThe switchback road down from Temple 24 gives a stunning vista of the upcoming Kochi prefecture. I keep stopping at every bend to take more photos. It’s a glorious walking day, with clouds blocking the wrath of the sun, and refreshing blasts of the wind warding off the heat.\nThe rest of the walk to Temple 25 is an uneventful strip of houses along the coast. These are common throughout Shikoku. Tsunami warning signs marking the wave height and the direction of the closest shelter are also common here. The tsunami height, it seems, varies several metres every few blocks.\nAs it begins to drizzle, I take shelter at a shuttered shop and have a hardboiled egg and peanuts as lunch on-the-go. I haven’t passed any convenience store, so the eggs as whole food feel like a luxury. Luxury foods are light, filling, transportable, and tasty. I can’t tell if I’m just easily pleased, or if self-imposed poverty has rewired my brain.\nI’ve been thinking about the friends that have been there to help me through life’s storms over the years and the ones that come to mind are often from my Masters degree in London. As I walk, London’s summer parks appear in my mind’s eye. The places I’ve stayed there and the successive cooking sessions with generous and laid back company at different ends of the city play back in succession. These are the friends I’m dedicating the next two temples to.\nShinshou-ji is a compact temple stacked on terraces separated by narrow, steep stairs. It’s got a cramped, around the corner vibe. I light my incense, say my prayers, get the temple stamp, and am back out as the raindrops begin to stain the stone stone steps.\nThere’s a grocery store right beside the temple and I jump on the chance for a proper, balanced meal. I pick up a bento and sit in the empty eating area. I imagine it being packed during Spring and Fall, peak pilgrimage seasons. Then, I notice wall plugs and charge my phone while I pick away at my rice and side dishes. A great value meal, especially with an outlet thrown in!\nBut I can’t wait until my phone’s charged and I need to get going. The last temple for today is only 4 kilometres away, so I have no excuse to miss it. It feels like I’ve had a full day, but it’s barely past 2:30pm when I leave the mini supermarket.\nIt begins to rain again when I leave the town and enter the woods that insulate Kongouchou-ji from the rest of the world. The path is dug out between the trees, with a Brother’s Grimm forest atmosphere. The trees protect me from the rain, but also keep the path moist and a muddy heaven for mosquitos. I race on, stabbing my staff through the mud, trying to escape the buzzing around my ear.\nI reach the temple just before 4pm, as the rain continues in earnest. I drop my bag on a covered bench and do my first round of prayers at the Main Hall. Looking at my damp bag, I wonder if I should get a plastic incense case that I’ve seen other henro carry.\nNevermind. I’ll worry about that after I’m done the prayers at the Daishi Hall. As I’m lighting my incense at the urn, I notice a round case placed intentionally beside the complimentary lighters.\nNo way! I open it, and it even has some sticks inside. I light one, and offer a quiet thanks to whomever left it. It’s not the first time I’ve seen people leave things in temples. I’ve seen candles, incense, staves, cups, and even candy. I’m moved by how pilgrims leave such useful, personal things behind for others whom they’ll never meet. When my time comes, I’ll put this pass this case forward too.\nOn the way down from Temple 26, I stop at a Michi-no-Eki hoping to find dinner and a place to camp. There aren’t bentos, so I make do with a 2L bottle of mugicha and a snack. There are no comfortable covered areas to pitch a tent, so I reluctantly move on through the the town of Kiragawa. I’m focused on spotting shops and a camping spot. Despite my map marking stores, I pass the entire town without finding a single open convenience store or restaurant.\nIt’s my first taste of Kochi’s isolation and rural attrition.\nI look ruefully at the empty, weather-stained buildings. Dying communities like these, apparent to even a foreigner like me, are all over Japan. The abstracts of rural depopulation and an ageing society have visible scars here. It’s a sobering thought during this sombre, overcast evening.\nI’ve been pampered the past few nights with rides, homes, and beds and found this last stretch after Temple 26 a dragged-out pain. Why can’t I just call it a day?!\nHut after hut, I stop to check if it’s the one I’ve marked on the map. Every time I wonder if I should just stop, even though it’s not the one. Impatience, boredom, and fatigue are a heavy mix.\nEventually, I find the cemetery I’m looking for. Past that, at the triangular intersection, is my hut. It’s bare, square wooden platform to sleep on and perfectly supports my tent size. I drop my anxieties along with my bag. I’ve been both apprehensive and eager to camp. I’d bought my tent for this trip, and it makes up 10% of my luggage weight. My determination to get my money’s worth wins over my fear of being exposed and alone.\nAfter setting it up, I rinse the sheet of sweat from my arms and legs with the massive wash basin outside the toilet. I can even shampoo my shaved head. The washroom is immaculate, with three vases and a flower each at the sink, squat toilet and urinal. Once cleaned up, I notice the flaming golden horizon just across the street. It rips through the dark blanket of rain clouds. I grab my digicam and phone camera and cross the street. It feels like a gift, a small encouragement for the weary who still lift their heads.\nOnce done, I crawl into my tent and call it a night. I lie there in the heat, with the cool ocean breeze fluttering under my tent flap. In a tent alone, every sensation feels new, the most prominent one being the individual weathered logs against my back (I didn’t bring a mat).\nSuddenly, I remember the recent Facebook newsfeeds with summer photos in Toronto, rainbows, events, and invitations. This is a the last Saturday of June. Exactly this time a year ago, I was enjoying Toronto’s World Pride events. I grab my phone to type these final words before tucking in:\n Today is probably the Pride Parade in Toronto. And I’m sleeping on a bench beside the sea. While the floats are being decorated, I’ve pissed in a urinal to avoid a gigantic spider. And today is the first time I’ve pitched my tent. First time I slept out was in a toilet two days ago. This is better.\n Kochi’s already making an impact. How sparse and gruff my words have have become.\n"});index.add({'id':13,'href':'/book/docs/Diary-Entries/day-8/','title':"Day 8 - June 28",'section':"Diary Entries",'content':"=====\nKiragawa 吉良川 → Kōnomine-ji 神峰寺\nTemples: 27 Kōnomine-ji (神峰寺)\nWeather: Sunny\nTravel Method: Walking\nDistance: 25 km\n=====\nMy cell is going to die. That’s my first thought when I wake with it squashed under my shoulder, overheated and drained of the full battery it had last night. I can feel the film of sweat on my face, even though I woke up several times from the breeze that carried increasingly cool air.\nI add a mental note to my growing list of henro wisdom: don’t put cell beside you when sleeping. It’s not a problem. I have map and there’s only one main road to follow.\nI wriggle around in my tent gathering the things inside (valuables, clothes as pillow, mosquito repellent). Finally, I unzip my mosquito net and stick my feet outside. It’s cool! Wait…no mosquitos?! I feel giddy already.\nDaylight sweeps through the sky even though it’s barely 5am, but the sun is lumbering behind the wall of mountains flanking the sea. The tip is Cape Muroto, where I walked from yesterday. Its distance gives me a sense of accomplishment, that a place so far away only took half a day. Even though walking henro usually set out at 5am, I want to hang around until I see sunrise over the hills.\nAs I’m eating breakfast, a fully-equipped henro charges down the road. I freeze. I’m not ready to chat this early. However, he marches right past me and my bright orange tent. He seems in such a rush.\nI, on the other hand, skip across the street to the sea wall and take pictures until the sunlight finally hits my face. My skin dries in minutes, and I take it as a sign to get going before it gets too hot. I gulp down the remaining roasted barley tea from last night’s 2L bottle to lighten my load.\nToday’s walking begins with sunshine, blue sky, and clouds. I’ll follow Route 55 along the coast through the towns of Nahari, Tano, and Yasuda before heading up to Konomine-ji, Temple 27. I plan to stay overnight at the temple’s tsuyado, which is free for walking henro. I learned about this lodging the usual henro way: down the grapevine.\nHunting for places to stay is a large part of my henro adventure. In addition to my map with red dotted lines to each temple, I have several lists for ‘nojuku’, camping or free lodgings with entries like ‘Kaifu bus stop’, or ‘Daishido 500m right of the Kaifu Bus Stop’. Those who update them seem confident newcomers will figure things out.\nThe solid plan today frees me up to enjoy the scenery. Only two hours after starting, I chill beside the sea, jumping between the large boulders, studying the humungous barnacles, and watching swarms of black, Paleozoic Era descendants crawl over the polished rock.\nThe sun is reaching its highest when I enter Nahari. Finally, the heat gets to me, and I drop my bag beside a tree and plant myself on the sidewalk under its solitary shade.\nI need food. I need water. I look inside my plastic grocery bag. Why is this turning out to be so hard?\nReflexively, I also pull out my Shikoku Japan 88 Route Guide and scan to see what’s here. Nahari is where the Kochi train line starts. There are enough people to justify its existence, which itself is reassuring. There should be a grocery store. There is also an onsen, which means a bath! I really need a bath, or any pampering.\nI can probably make the onsen if I rush, but I don’t want to rush. I sit, my brain slow, stuck in indecision. I need food. Then, I notice someone carrying a grocery bag across the street. Isn’t that a supermarket?!\nI grab my bag and head straight for that air condition building I should’ve entered 15 minutes ago. It has food. I’m saved. Down a few blocks, there’s a Lawson with superglue. The sole of my shoe has been coming off for two days, since Hiwasa. I’m saved again. No more semi-limping.\n The rest of the walk through town is long. Despite knowing I am protected by sunscreen, the sun is scorching. I look at the cars racing by. Is anyone going to take pity?\nJust then, a car pulling out of a parking lot slows down and a gentleman rolls down his window. ‘Ohenro-san, are you an aruki-henro? Where are you going today?’\n‘Temple 27.’ I answer.\n‘Konomine-ji? And you’re walking?? Why don’t I give you a ride? It’s so hot!’\nIt is. I’m tempted. Why not accept his generosity?\nBut I also decided I’d walk Kochi. ‘I’m fine, thank you. I’d like to walk.’\n‘Are you sure?’\n‘Daijyoubudesu.‘ I say more confidently than I feel. I’ll be fine. ‘Thank you very much!’\nHe leaves saying, ‘Okiosuketekudasai’ – Take care! It is the customary thing for everyone to say to henro. All I can do is bow as he turns out onto the road.\nI feel like I’ve passed a test. I don’t need a ride. It seems, I didn’t need that onsen and bath either to restore my spirits. I smile and continue, no less susceptible to the sun, but much less under its sway.\n Entering Yasuda Town. Empty streets and stripped buildings are common in Kochi.\nBy two, I’m almost out of Yasuda. I stop outside of the Nagomi Community Centre for shade. Procedure for breaks: decide it’s an ideal spot, take a huge gulp of water, drop backpack (optional), consult 88 Route Guide Book, decide if there’s time to sit, sit (usually reflexive). I’m caught gulping by a small lady with coiffed hair and skin folded with age smiles as she emerges from the sliding door. ‘Ohenro-san! Please wait a moment!’\nShe disappears before I can even greet her. There’s distant rummaging. She probably has food, and I probably need more. There’ll be nothing up at the temple. Apart from my lunch bento, I only got a bag of genpi, a local snack of sugar-coated and deep-fried potato sticks that are perfectly high-calorie, lightweight, and easy-storage.\nEventually she reemerges with bottled tea, snacks, and hand-made trinkets. The two stuffed owls are named ‘Furoro’, and I tie one of them beside my bell on my staff. We have the usual conversation, where I explain that I’m Canadian, but my parents are Chinese, and I’m working in Hong Kong.\nThen, she notices my grocery bag. ‘Oh, you already have food…’ She’s disappointed.\n‘It’s only snacks, and I’m always hungry and thirsty!’ I don’t want to lose food opportunities! ‘Especially in this heat.’\n‘So-da-yo-ne?’ She says. That’s true. ‘Then, please take this!’ She thrusts the bags of snacks at me again. It’s a bit too much to fit, but I fill my bag as best as I can. To prove my point about thirst, I finish my bottle of water that I’d been rationing up until now. Her tea will be essential from this point forward!\n‘It’s another two hours before you reach Konomine-ji,’ she remarks.\n‘Really?!’ I thought it was just another three kilometres. ‘I was hoping to finish in an hour.’\n‘No, no. That’s impossible. It’s so steep!’ She makes an incline with her forearm.\nThen, I should get going! If she’s right, I’ll be cutting close to the temple’s closing time. If this morning’s speedy henro decided to stay at the temple tsuyado, I’ll also have to head all the way back down and find somewhere else. Temples usually have a strict gender segregation rule.\nI start my final leg, sailing on the grandma’s goodwill. There isn’t another market, shop, restaurant, or convenience store on the way up. Her dorayaki is better than gold.\n The glow of evening hovers in the rustling vines, the sunlight slowly sliding its way across my tsuyado outer wall. Konomine-ji is as beautiful as Aurelie promised. It’s 4:45pm, and I’m waiting for the temple to close down so I can enter my lodging. I’ve already wiped my arms and legs, and washed some clothes in the public basin around the corner. I’m hoping the formidable sun will dry the clothes some before nightfall.\nHenro survival is reduced practical opportunism.\nKonomine-ji is an elegant place, with well carved buildings and carefully pruned bushes along the stairways that connect the various sections. It’s famous for its sweet mountain spring water running down the moss-covered rocks into a pool. I gulped down an entire bottle’s worth, with Kannon smiling benignly at me. I trust Bodhisattvas and Buddhas aren’t as uptight as humans are about etiquette in times of need.\nSitting at 500 metres above sea level, it is considered a henro korogashi, a place where a henro ‘falls down’ or nansho, a ‘difficult place’ because the 45-degree climb that extends over a kilometre.\nThe last henro korogashi I walked was Tairyuu-ji and it feels as distant in time as it does in kilometres. Walking every day, time passes quickly, and the few events that occupy them expand in memory.\nWhen the sun slips behind the mountains, I head inside to snack and charge my dead phone. It might be a while before I find another outlet. While it’s not essential, the free Maps.me and Strava apps are useful for locating myself, and recording my daily pace and distance.\nThe lady who minds the temple shop knocks on the door, which I’ve already locked since I want to sleep. She tells me I shouldn’t lock it or close the curtains before it’s completely dark, so I can save energy by not using a light. She then gives me a list of other instructions. She speaks in a brisk, economical and direct way. A while later, she comes back with a tray with two fresh mochi and a cup of green tea. I suspect she probably knew I didn’t have a proper dinner.\nBefore leaving, she repeats several times, ‘It’s safe here. Don’t worry.’\nI take a bite of the mochi. It’s is fresh and aromatic with something floral. I’d like to think I’m a mochi connoisseur, but this one’s especially delicious. With the laundry hanging, everything charging, and a slightly fuller belly, I settle down to capture today’s bullet points.\n Today is Pride, I realised that across the world, crowds and communities were decorating floats celebrating a type of diversity.\nThe walk to Nahari is longer than it looks. It feels endless. So did the walk out of Nahari and Tano into Yasuda. Oddly enough, the walk up the mountain that everyone had warned me of was not as bad as I’d anticipated.\nYesterday, I departed from Shishikui with a light step and even after Temple 26, I powered onward to my first camping experience.\nToday started in a more bumpy fashion. The straps were eating at my shoulders right after setting off, and I’d mispacked and had to reorganize several times.\nToday I downed 2000L of liquid – probably just enough to replenish the sweat.\nToday has been a day of many gifts.\n "});index.add({'id':14,'href':'/book/docs/Diary-Entries/day-9/','title':"Day 9 - June 29",'section':"Diary Entries",'content':"=====\nKōnomine-ji 神峰寺 → Ioki 伊尾木 → Aki 安芸 → Akano 赤野 → Yasu 夜須 → Kagami 香我美\nTemples: None\nWeather: Sunny\nTravel Method: Walking\nDistance: 35.3 km\n=====\nI woke up in the middle of the night only once, which is an accomplishment. I wake again in the dark before 5:00 because I had originally wanted to climb to the peak and see sunrise. Finally, my alarm goes off again at 6:00, and I’m behind schedule. I told the temple office lady I’d leave by around this time.\nI pack up and sweep the tatami mats, but after that, I wait another 10 minutes my laundry to dry a little more, another 5 minutes for my phone to charge a bit more. It’s a priceless morning that only walking henro who stay over in the tsuyado get. Rather than just move on, I want to at least enjoy the places I’m passing through, these singular moments.\nThe temple lady comes in to check on me and chides me saying I should get going in order to reach Temple 28 today, which is 40 kilometres away.\nI didn’t intend to walk that distance, but she’s right, I should get going!\n An hour later, I’m near the base of the mountain and retracing my steps for the second time. In the span of 15 minutes, I’ve dropped the Furoro owl charm tied to my staff twice. I take deliberate steps up the road, scanning every inch of concrete that I’d just charged past only minutes before without a second thought.\nIt would’ve been easier to just forget about it. The Buddhist teachings say we should have non-attachment to material things, people, and concepts. I don’t think it’s a good excuse for abandoning something I dropped out of carelessness. I don’t feel much about losing it. I want to honour the maker and the elderly lady who gave me o-settai snacks yesterday. Acts of generosity should not be lightly discarded.\nThankfully, I find it the second time in the blinding white concrete. Suddenly, I remember John Wooden’s quote, “The true test of a man’s character is what he does when no one is watching.” I think another way to describe character is just what each person can live with.\n I feel like there are five Kochis: the historical one, the beach and surf one, the seafood one, the pilgrimage one, and the forgotten one.\nKochi is the homeland of Chōsokabe Motochika, the man who united Shikoku before surrendering to Toyotomi Hideyoshi, as well as Sakamoto Ryōma, one of the prominent figures to overthrow the Tokugawa Shogunate and the feudal system. It also is a hidden gem for surfers, with many locals closing shop to cross the road and ride the waves. Many others know Kochi for its katsuo, the fish used for bonito flakes to make dashi stock, and katsuotataki, a smokey grilled sashimi. To henro, this is the Dojo of Ascetic Training, the place where their determination is tested through the longest leg, with the fewest temples. Kochi only has 16 temples, but takes up 500km of the total 1200 km. It is an expanse looms in a henro’s psyche as days with nothing but road, sea, and sky.\nJust as harsh landscapes have an inexplicable allure, Kochi too is has a raw, force-of-nature. I pass the early morning, and high noon, afternoon, and evening meditating on the pull of this place. The route through Kochi traces a thin line of civilisation that’s as weathered, stunted, yet deeply rooted, as trees eeking out an existence over a stunning cliff face. Indeed, where are the people?\nThe first town of the day is tiny Ioki, significant because it is where I discover Lawson, the convenience store chain, has free WiFi. I spend two hours uploading photos and catching up with friends. Wi-Fi distracts me from the gathering heat reaching its noon climax.\nMy Facebook newsfeed reminds me that the Pride Parade happened while I was sleeping up in Konomine-ji. What a perfect coincidence that I discover internet just in time to make Pride! I flip through the photos, commenting, and sending greetings to friends in Toronto, knowing many of them are still partying into the night. It’s only 10pm over there. I smile imagining a cinematic juxtaposition of the pitch black mountain I slept on and Lady Gaga blasting from the floats and stages to the crowds in Toronto’s concrete jungle.\nI tell the friend I’d prayed for at Konomine-ji about the view there. He has already achieved professional heights few of his contemporaries would dream of, but those are almost after thoughts as he aims for his his personal summits. He cycles in the snow and rents a one-bedroom apartment when he could have bought a house because his wealth goes to his friends, surgery funds for others, and support for refugees and marginalised groups. As I heaved up the mountain yesterday, careful to keep a steady pace lest I get winded, I was glad to have him.\nSome time later, I’m at a bend where I can look back at the series of points jutting out into the sea. The furthest one is just a dark felt-marker line above the water. I’m just past Ananai station and there are only two buildings here perched at the edge of the cliff with this stunning view. Ahead of me, the road slides down into the next town of Akano, with its balmy spread of beach lined with a tropical treeline separating it from the strip of settlement creeping up into the hills.\nIt’s the first time I see the distance I’ve covered. The miles are adding up. Every time I look back, I know I’ve covered the entire distance to the horizon. I’m a bit mind blown.\nAlso, a bit exhausted. And a bit hungry.\nI pick up a mochi from the outpost shop, I finish it and continue. I’ve covered about 20 kilometres and it’s fast approaching 3pm. If I want, I can stop in about 5 more kilometres at the other end of the beach and call it a day.\nThe thought that I can end early today and still have an entire evening ahead spurs me on. Soon, I’m down by the water, letting the waves wash past my knees. My legs are happy, but my upper half is still roasting. No wonder there’s not a soul here. Soon, I retreat to the leafy recreational path behind the beach.\nIt is here that I find the invisible, forgotten Kochi, the one made up of people’s lives. On the recreational path, I see people who strolling, walking their dogs, cycle to and from school. In gardens, there are colourful hand-cut pinwheels and small rows of vegetables. It’s easy to think of Kochi as abandoned, desolate, lonely, unless you look for these small signs of care.\nBy 4:45pm, I reach the zenkonyado that was on my nojuku henro guide list. The neat row of shacks are run by a Hagamori-san, who has left a contact number on a board. Inside the metal sheet walls are futons, kitchenware, cookstoves. There’s at least one ragged henro enjoying the quarters.\nI reached my goal. I could stop.\nI haven’t been sleeping enough ever since I started, and I think I’ll sleep soundly here. When I do nojuku, every sound wakes me up. It’s only between 4-6am, when the sky gets bright, that I finally get a good chunk of rest. When I’ve stayed with other people, I sleep well, but not enough. Somehow, my body’s adjusted, but it doesn’t have time to heal my shoulder and neck.\nYet, the sun still so high up. My mind is still energetic, and wants to spend the daylight hours walking.\nI could just treat myself to a restaurant meal. But food has lost its appeal. Now, it’s just something to keep me going because I don’t want to eat into walking time. I love onigiri, so breakfast, lunch and dinner are always equally tasty. I just no longer have cravings for anything in particular.\nWhen did I become like this? I’ve only just started, but I’m changing so fast I catch myself.\nAnother reason I’m reluctant to finish here today is because Aurelie told me that the beach on the other side of this one that is gorgeous. I really want to see a sunset over the distant sea. If I’m not longer indulging in mouth-watering food, I’m going to indulge in beautiful sights.\nAlright, it’s decided. I’m moving on. Before that, I’ll treat myself to a quick nap on the raised boards here first.\n Looking back at the map, I walked six extra kilometres, not three. But it was a great lie. It got me to Ya Sea Park. I made it in time to watch the sheets of sunlight ripple and fade away, like apparitions in the distant storm clouds. Purple and blue hues of the distant hills across the bay continually shift with the pale evening sun.\nMy left collar bone feels like it’s been smashed, and the muscles from my back to my neck and chin are so tight I’m worried they’ll pop. If it weren’t for my staff to hold up me up, I’d have deflated under the weight of my bag half way here.\nStill, sitting on the steps leading down to the sandy beach, I wouldn’t trade it. I’ve washed my feet in the public fountains, stretched my toes on cool, moist grass. I’m really done for today. I could sleep here. There are plenty of quiet corners and terraces just behind me. I have a walking henro luxury: time, and something to enjoy it with.\nBut I really need food. It feels like ages ago since I had that calorically insufficient soba for lunch. So as darkness sets in, I follow my map to the closest convenience store another kilometre or so away to get bento dinner and brush my teeth. Convenience store toilets are so clean. There is a henro rest hut listed just behind it, too.\nAfter dinner, when it’s dark, I have trouble navigating the dark residential streets. Eventually, I see an angular silhouette against the blue-darkness of the sky. As I approach, I see another henro already preparing to tuck in. It’s the one who blew past me yesterday! Why is he still here?!\nI think I’ll sleep better with someone else close by. And, this henro hut has futons – weather-stained, but it’s padding!\nAs I make space to lie down on the bench, I exchange stories with the other henro. We missed each other at Yokomine-ji because he had camped at the foot of the foot of the mountain, not knowing there was a tsuyado after visiting the temple. Secretly, I’m glad. He was able to clock more miles, and I got a good night’s lodging.\nI see him light mosquito incense under his bench. Damn. I need to get that. The incense was essentials when I volunteered on farms, but I haven’t picked up any at the convenience stores yet. They’re much more effective than the spray I’ve been dousing myself with.\n‘Do you have it?’ He asks.\n‘Nope, but I have mosquito spray.’\nHe already spraying his clothes with a heavy-duty can. ‘Would you like some?’\nSure! He has plenty more to spare than me.\nWith not much else to do, it’s a good time to call it a day. My body relaxes and lets the fatigue wash in. I cover my face and ears, knowing at some point, the mosquitos gathering will wake me up hovering around my ear.\n‘What if I’m a killer?’ My companion ventures in the darkness.\nKillers don’t torture themselves camping out for days in hopes of finding another solo henro to kill at a hut. He’s been working a few years, but it sounds like a high school-type joke.\n‘I hope not!’ I say in English. I think he’ll understand. More importantly, I look Chinese. Thanks to colonialism, English, and its associated countries of the US, Canada, and the UK, still inspire an unjustified respect in many places in the world. For tonight, I’ll use what it’s worth as an added layer of protection so I can sleep better. In the end, I am just a solo-female camper.\nHe chuckles, and we both say goodnight.\n"});index.add({'id':15,'href':'/book/docs/Diary-Entries/day-10/','title':"Day 10 - June 30",'section':"Diary Entries",'content':"=====\nKagami 香我美 → Nankoku City 南国市 → Kochi City 高知市\nTemples: 28 (Dainichi-ji 大日寺), 29 (Tosa Kokubun-ji 土佐国分寺), 30 (Zenrakuji 善楽寺)\nWeather: Sunny → Cloudy → Rain\nTravel Method: Walking\nDistance: 26.9 km\n=====\nThe birds begin chirping just before night melts into dawn. It’s not even 5:00am. I peek over at the henro on the other side of the hut. He hasn’t stirred. Feeling justified, I pull up my covers again.\nNext thing I know, there’s shuffling. I peak out of my covers and see the other henro squatting to rummage through his backpack. I slowly push myself upright and sit until my head has cleared. My bag is packed, since I didn’t change into anything clean last night before lying down on the seat cushions and using one of the provided blankets. Snacking takes three minutes. Stacking the cushions and blanket takes two.\nI decide to continue the conversation we left off last night as my companion is squatting over the tap brushing his teeth. ‘So why are you doing this?’\nHe lost his job back in Tokyo and had time. He says it casually, but I don’t press further. It’s an answer, but not necessarily a reason, not that it matters. Nor is it my business.\n‘Do you plan to finish all the temples in one go?’ I venture in rudimentary Japanese.\nHe’ll go as far as he can. Stop whenever. He has no plans. He’s probably also realised that my Japanese is only good enough to ask questions, but not to understand the answers. He checks his feet, wrapping up his toes with band aids. It seems he has blisters.\n‘Does it hurt?’ I don’t know what else to say.\n‘A bit. It’s what happens when you walk too fast,’ he says mildly.\nI don’t have them yet. I wonder if it’s just because I haven’t walked enough yet. Many of my marathon friends get them. When they recount their runs, they seem to take it as part of the package. I’m glad I forgot to add them to the ‘cons’ list when deciding whether to do this.\nAfter waiting a while, I don’t have much else to do, and I want to make the most of my morning energy. ‘Then, I’ll go ahead first.’\n‘Go-yukkuri.’ He says. Take it easy.\nIt’s a short 5 kilometre walk to Temple 28, so I make a detour into a convenience store and hang around for an hour discretely charging my cell phone while having breakfast. I only leave after I see my henro companion go by.\nThe rest of the walk on the highway with roaring trucks and grey suburbia feels long. I’ll need to wade through this characterless, suburban sprawl before I can finally reach Kochi City, with all its promises of modern city convenience. By the time I get to the foot of Dainichi-ji, my breakfast sends me shooting up the staircases to the temple in search of the toilet. I guess indigestion, however mild, probably gets to nojuku-henro at some point.\nAfter the toilet, relieved and revived, I do my prayers. After, I sit and enjoy the morning stillness from a corner of the temple complex. In cities, empty temples always feel neglected, but on Shikoku, they seem to have a quiet dignity that deserves to be left alone. It’s a good opportunity to poke around and take photos.\nI study the distinct temple architecture beginning with the slanted roof and eaves, which are supported by tokyō, a system of supporting blocks made entirely of wood. The supports are often decorated with dragons, clouds, and other imagery. This extended roof shrouds the inner shrine in a dim, mysterious atmosphere. Only the gold-leaf candle holders, pillars, and statue reflect outside light. It’s impossible to catch the detailed craftsmanship without a flash.\nBut even the sun-bleached ashen planks that make up the veranda have wonderfully textured grooves, sanded down and rounded by nature’s forces. The circular holes where branches once were fit a coin perfectly. I take a photo, engrossed in the moment.\n Farmland: rows of rice stalks soaked in pools of water, rows of dirt mounds with shrubs yielding purple flowers (future eggplants), beans, cucumbers, and the like, rows of plastic wrapping arched metal frames.\nA rusty tractor with a broken seat here, an orange and sand-coloured corrugated workshop there, a group flower-patterned ladies with farmers hats and mud-stained boots gathered along an irrigation channel. Everything has a dull lustre, a coat of … smog? Officially, this agricultural suburbia is a ‘city’ with barely 50,000 people. The past few days must have spoiled my eyes with nature’s unfiltered colours.\nThere’s no distraction from the pain in my left shoulder, which feels like it is steadily being severed from my twisted neck muscles. I’m about half-way to Gokubun-ji, Temple 29, which is a mere 9 kilometres from Temple 28. I’ve stopped several times already to roll my shoulder, stretch, and readjust. It’s not working, and it’s worrying.\nThere is good and bad pain. The pain of pushing yourself to get stronger, as athletes do, is highly addictive (endorphin kick). I was hoping this was good pain that would disappear as I adjusted to my bag. However, this shrill, tense strain can develop into a chronic problem that will nag at me years later. It isn’t immediately crippling, but it festers and warps your body that is trying to compensate. It feeds on your stubbornness, sapping the life out of your limbs. I finally admit that the multi-day battle that began a week ago has been lost.\nWith a mind numb with fatigue, I try to find the shortest route to an onsen that is on the way to Temple 29. It feels like I’m letting myself off easy again by stopping in so soon, and especially when the temples are so close to each other.\nSometimes, you just have to take that step back to move forward. I hope this onsen is worth it.\n Results usually take time, but when I pick up my bag again after two hours in the onsen, I can feel the immediate results. I have a fresh pair of feet and loosened upper neck muscles to last me through to evening.\nAs bonus, some laundry is done, some caffeine ingested. This was definitely worth it.\nI sail through the remaining commercial strip, across a bridge, and into Kokubun-ji, just as it begins to drizzle.\nIt only takes a few minutes to complete the routine now. I now write my osamefuda in the mornings before setting off. As I am packing my prayer incense, a group of bus henro come in. As they begin chanting, I head to the temple office, eager to beat the nokyoucho rush. Once inside, the clatter of raindrops becomes a cascade. With my nokyoucho in hand, I wait for the ink to dry and my phone to charge as I look out the open door at the deluge.\nThis temple is walled in by tall cedars, and has an interesting selection of trees throughout its grounds. This place turned out to be perfect for my two academic friends who work on environmental sciences and have their own cozy magazine-worthy garden hidden away in downtown Toronto. It is uncanny how suitable the temples have been for the people I’ve dedicated them to so far. I hope this keeps up.\nFrom here, I have two choices: to take a country road and call it a day at the henro hut called Kamohara, which looks nice from the photos I saw, or race through a highway to get to Temple 30 before it closes and figure out accommodation after that. It’s close almost 3:00pm.\nI can’t decide, so I revert to an old habit: hedge until the last-minute. I get out my umbrella and start walking, heading for the fork in the road where I’ll need to decide.\nAfter I make my decision, it’s an hour fraught with tension and anxiety.\nI choose the straight highway route to improve my chances of reaching Temple 30. As uncomfortable as it is, being splashed by trucks on a sidewalk won’t slow me down the way a muddy path will. Since I’m aiming for Temple 30, then I will get there at all cost. Failure to do so will mean no temple stamp, doubling back along the muddy road to the henro hut and spending the night soaked. That’s unacceptable: I’m still a city kid, after all.\nAbout half way there, I discover a large Family Mart and decide to make time for an early dinner. I haven’t eaten a proper meal since 6:00am. It also has a dining area, complete with plugs. I settle in for my microwaved meal and check the weather report with their free Wi-Fi. I also find out on Google Maps that I still have another 4 kilometres.\nShit. I scarf down the rice, use the washroom, and am off again.\nSoon, the rain clouds finally unleash their downpour. All I can do is strategically hold my umbrella so that my runners don’t get too wet. It requires a lot of concentration.\nI finally give in: I run.\nI jog in fits and starts, hoping that the minutes I shave every time will add up to a meaningful amount.\nAt 4:30pm, I cross a hill and see Kochi City shrouded in clouds. Civilisation. Almost there. And, I see the henro stickers again, stuck on the sign posts and along the fences, pointing me in the right direction. Thank god. I continue running, from one henro sticker to the next.\nAll my pain has disappeared.\nAfter entering the temple gate, I race to the stamp office, asking the staff if they’d mind me lighting the incense, doing things the proper way, before getting a nokyocho.\nThe small lady with wavy hair looks at me, soaked, gasping for breath, in mild shock. No, of course not. She asks me to take my time.\nReassured, I go back out to cleanse my hands and dedicate my prayers at the Main Hall. Today was for family in Toronto, and this last one goes to an aunt who’s more like a good friend that I went around Toronto with on the hunt for good coffee and Eggs Benedict.\nToday’s prayers at the Daishi Hall were all dedicated to a group of girls in a shelter in Cambodia after being taken out of the brothels or abusive homes. Their center had an overnight funding withdrawal due to an international media scandal. Despite all their efforts to move past their traumatic pasts, to improve their future prospects through education and work, they are just invisible casualties in a global arena. It is a sobering reality, and depressing truth that I could do little for them. All I can do in this moment is pray. I hope there really are higher beings that can set right humanity’s countless wrongs.\n It’s just after six when I walk into the hotel lobby leaving a trail of puddles. The staff at reception greet me with unwavering politeness and patience as I put my soaked bag down and rummage for my passport.\nThe temple office helped me make a phone reservation earlier. The reception lady offers whatever she can, an o-settai breakfast, a drink coupon, and even a complimentary shoe dryer for my soaked runners. As I head to my room, the lady tells me about their onsen. Even though I avoid hotels as a shoestring backpacker, it already feels worth it.\nAfter I’ve peeled off my dripping clothes, I go down to the restaurant for dinner. Normally, I’d have gone to a convenient store, but there are none close by. Besides, after walking the extra three kilometres through the city, in the rain, I should probably treat myself. Desperate times calls for desperate expenditures. After three days of nojuku, and being drenched, peace of mind, a warm room, and a good night’s sleep feel priceless. I’m glad I have savings for times like these.\n As I have my second onsen soak of the day, I think back to how I got here.\nBefore Zenraku-ji locked the doors, the woman who first greeted me sent me off with an o-mamori, a charm. ‘For good luck,’ she said.\nMeeting her and her colleague was already enough luck for me. Her charm will forever be a reminder of this day with all its highs and lows.\nEven the three-kilometre walk here felt nice. I waddled my way into Kochi City with my thin cotton Thai trousers clinging to my legs. My runners were soggy sponges with a bed of needles, but it didn’t dampen my spirits. I took my time. I took photos. I was soaked already: it couldn’t get worse!\nI arrived at the hotel with a beaming smile, probably the cheeriest soaked guest they’d ever had.\n"});index.add({'id':16,'href':'/book/docs/Diary-Entries/day-11/','title':"Day 11 - July 1",'section':"Diary Entries",'content':"=====\nKochi City (高知市)\nTemples: 31 Chikurin-ji (竹林寺), 32 Zenjibu-ji (禅師峰寺)\nWeather: Cloudy with Sunny Parts\nTravel Method: Walking\nDistance: 17.1 km\n=====\nMy alarm goes off in the pitch-black room. I resent it with a passion I never felt when woken by sunshine and the cheerful birds after a sleepless nojuku night. In the fog of fatigue after a first good night’s rest, I drag myself out of the fluffy comforter and soft bed, change, and head downstairs for the complimentary breakfast.\nMy breakfast was waiting for me on a table by the window. It’s a full Japanese breakfast with salmon, tsukemono, side dishes, miso, and rice followed by a Western breakfast with omelette and toast. I eat it wistfully while listening to the two businessmen in the next table, watching the rain.\nJust before bed last night, I confirmed an AirBnB place to stay close to the next temple, Chukurin-ji. I’ll stay two nights while walking to the temples around Kochi City. The weather forecasted rain today and tomorrow, so I used an AirBnB coupon that was about to expire.\nI type up some brief notes about my walk yesterday while I sip my coffee. It’s going to be a chill day.\nI leave the hotel close to 10am and head south to my new lodgings. The route runs along the canals that lead out to the bay. In the distance, the wispy sheets of clouds roll through the steel-blue mountains, as though they’re not quite ready to ascend to heaven.\nIt’s a quick 40-minute walk, but I almost double the time as I stretch the minutes observing the scenery. Even though I’m in the city, the buildings are low, taking up little space on the horizon with the distant hills and expansive sky.\nMy AirBnB host has left the door to the modern loft-house unlocked for me. Many rural places and small cities in Japan are still like that. Farm houses have open sliding doors; kitchen doors are left open for a draft. People leave parcels and baskets of vegetables at your door if you are out. People just say ‘Just go in’.\nAfter quickly dropping my things off at the entrance, I take a grocery bag of prayer essentials and snacks. Even though having a place feels like vacation, I still need to do my daily duties of temple visiting.\nRight beside the house is a stone marker with the words so worn they’re barely legible. Chukurin-ji, the next temple, is supposed to be up this hill, and this natural route seems more interesting than the car route spiralling up. I’ll take my chances.\nThe stairs eventually lead to wide dirt path surrounded by emerald trees glistening from the recent rain. The path takes me through old graves, some clustered and others solitary. Nature has already wrapped her roots around many.\nThe last flight of stairs has become a gurgling stream fed by yesterday’s rainwater. It’s captivating, a display of nature’s ability to reclaim even the most enduring of human accomplishments.\nI take photos, trying to capture the moment, ignoring the mosquitos descending on my exposed legs, unprotected by mosquito repellent. Climbing the stream is a refreshing rinse for my feet, which are in Keen sandals, rather than my usual runners today.\nAccording to legend, the Emperor Shomu ordered Gyōki to find a place similar to Godai-san (五台山) in China, and this was the chosen spot in the late 8th Century. The temple has extensive gardens from the Edo Period and various statues that date from the Heian through to the Muromachi Periods. Its moss-covered stones and tōrō, stone lanterns, speak to the grace of age. Nature has embraced this human outpost by growing a blanket of moss around the deciduous trees, and coaxing the tall cedars behind to protective heights. The young Japanese maples are shimmering in the hovering mist. The light rain hopscotches over the leaves. The grounds are humming silently.\nI have time today, so I walk through the various gardens taking photos, noting mushrooms, checking each small shrine. I take a few photos with the Sigg water bottle the friends I dedicated this temple to gave me years ago. I’ll send it to them tonight.\nThe next best thing to having friends beside you is taking a part of them with you. They continue to help you move forward.\nAn hour later, I’m back in fields between the hills. Even though I am still in Kochi City, the river I’m walking along cuts through rice paddies. Only weeks ago, most rice stalks were still uniform patches of leafy grass, bending with the path of the wind. Now, they are beginning to droop. In the Fall, they will be harvested. I’m glad to have this natural course to Zenjibu-ji. Even a small city like Kochi is already too much concrete now.\nHere, there are few cars, fewer people, and many henro stickers stuck on walls, lamposts and forks in the road. These red icons are the familiar little friends that assure me I’m going in the right direction.\nWithout my backpack today, I feel like a turtle without its shell. I twirl my staff and place it on my shoulders, dangling my arms on top. Eventually, I trip over Kobo Daishi (as in, my staff) and stumble a few steps forward. Some things don’t change, like being clumsy. Maybe I should just accept it. Not all lessons have to be hard and painful.\n The simple route on my guide book suggested that Zenjibu-ji would just appear behind houses like many other temples. In the end, I spent a good half-hour searching for the path that I knew was painfully close. It was around the other side of a lake, through a row of houses in a small village, past another temple, and up a hill on an unmaintained, slippery, mosquito-ridden path. They don’t make it easy. In normal life, I’d have thrown up my arms and turned back ages ago, more out of frustration than physical hardship.\nI arrive at the same time as a group of bus henro and the stairs up to the Main Hall have a momentary traffic jam of heaving white bodies with conical straw caps.\nAt the top, I am bask in the momentary sunshine, from a lookout point. Two ladies with covered heads and sunglasses also pause here while the others mill around the courtyard.\n‘It’s beautiful isn’t it?’ They murmur to each other.\n‘Indeed,’ I respond uninvited. It feels like a view best shared, even if between strangers.\n‘And it’s so nice it ended up being sunny!’ One continues.\n‘Indeed, indeed,’ the other adds in.\nThen they turn to me. ‘Did you walk here?’\n‘Yep.’\n‘How are you going around?’\n‘Walking the entire thing.’\n‘Ehhhh?!’ Whhhaaaattt??\n‘Alone?’\n‘Alone!’\nThen one of them hesitates and asks if I’m a girl. My shaved head, bandana and unflattering sportswear look male, but my voice gives me away. I confirm that I am. Female aruki-henro are rare, and it’s unfathomable to Japanese that they would do nojuku alone.\nThey continue the questions. Where do I stay? What?! Nojuku?! Why am I doing this? Oh, from Canada? Chinese? They thought I was a Japanese Nisei.\nIt’s flattering, and helpful. Being mistaken for Japanese will get more friendly responses than being read as Chinese given the current political tensions between Japan and China.\nEventually, their tour guide rounds them up to begin prayers and they excuse themselves, saying the customary, ‘O-kiosukete.’\nI let the entire group finish their chants and collect their staves left at the wooden box stands. With the herd gone, I can light my incense for my family friends in peace and quiet. They are from the same hometown as my dad, although they are my maternal aunt’s friends. Ever since I’d met them, they’ve treated me like family, the way Chaozhou / Shantou people do for each other. Their homemade Chow-Shan dishes, following traditional ingredients and methods to the last detail, are better than the ubiquitous restaurants in Hong Kong that cut corners to make a profit. Chow-Shan people are also notoriously picky about their seafood, being from a rugged coastal region fortified by mountains; my friends would have loved Kochi’s katsuotataki.\nNext is the routine visit to the temple office for a stamp. There’s a monk and lady manning the small shop entrance. They radiate a sense of gentle cheerfulness, patiently waiting as I try to decide whether to get some postcards drawn by a local artist. Outside is a small, homey garden with potted plants everywhere. In contrast, the detached house just beside the office is clean, but sagging with age and accumulated items.\nAfter sitting for a bit in the garden, I set off to the ferry port, where I take I can take a free ferry to Temple 33 on the other side of Urado Bay. I still have time. Maybe.\nBy four, my ankles are dying from the lack of arch support and I ditch racing to Temple 33. Besides, there’s a supermarket and I still need lunch! I do a shopping binge and buy daifuku, genpi (my local favourite), bananas and a pre-made burdock root dish. With the spoils of supermarket wandering, I go to the dining area and dig in.\nThe daifuku is only 200 Yen for 5 and freshly made, with a chewy texture and distinct yomogi flavour. Such honest prices! I love rural Japan.\nWhen I finish, I do a quick walk down to the ferry port, so that I know what it looks like tomorrow morning. From there, I can catch a direct bus home.\nIt’s an open lot, with a shack on one side as a bus stop, and a shack by the retaining wall for the ferry passengers. There’s a young boy with a bike talking to a gentleman in a suit. They see me milling around, and come over to have a chat. The boy is actually university-age and working. He and the salary-man commute across the bay to work.\nI talked my quota today up at Temple 32, so I don’t have much to say. I’m more interested in the young man’s road bike and their original conversation.\nEventually, the salary-man asks what I’d like to drink. I politely decline.\n‘I have money, yo!’ He says.\nI wouldn’t mind a drink but it still feels odd because he hasn’t offered it as o-settai, in the way supporters typically do upfront. Here, I can’t quite tell if there’s any added implication.\nThe salary-man gives up and looks at the young man, who swiftly accepts with, ‘Sumimasen!’ I let out a sight of relief as they march in solidarity across the lot to the vending machine.\nA few minutes later, they’re back. The gentleman hands me a half-sized yellow yuzu drink. This time, I gratefully accept. I’ve wanted try this for a while! I need to remind myself to open up a little to people’s generosity.\nEventually, a mast floats closer and closer above the sea barricades. When it’s stopped, the gate is drawn up, and a handful of people pedal and drive off. Then, the small crowd that’s gathered in the lot file into the ferry. My companions take their leave too.\nUnlike Tokyo, however, the gate doesn’t close even though it’s past departure time. I hear the roar of a motorcycle, and it flies through the parking lot straight onto the ferry. No-one flinches. Maybe they’re expecting him.\nAfter catching the bus back home, I have time to enjoy a second snack. My AirBnB host has arranged a sampling of teas, snacks, and tomatoes on the counter for me. In addition, she said guests could help themselves to the vegetables in the fridge if they cook. I certainly will!\nI have so many things to fill my evening with! I put on some French music, scan her wall of books, put together ingredients for miso soup and go upstairs to check out the golden sunset highlighted with magenta and violet clouds. All these little things make me feel like I have a home again, that I can put away the vagabond identity and bring out another self for the two days that I’m here.\nAfter dark, my host comes over to explain how to use the laundry machine, since I couldn’t figure it out. She tells me her former husband designed this gorgeous loft-house, which explains the blend of aesthetics and utility in the details like lighting, washroom materials, tiling, etc. She’s a French teacher, which explains her wall bookshelf. I’m glad to put a face to a name for my host.\nI finish making dinner, have a shower, and pluck a French-Japanese version of the The Little Prince off the shelves to read before going to bed.\nIt’s been a very, very good day.\n"});index.add({'id':17,'href':'/book/docs/Diary-Entries/day-12/','title':"Day 12 - July 2",'section':"Diary Entries",'content':"=====\nKochi City (高知市)\nTemples: 33 Sekkei-ji (雪蹊寺), 34 Tanema–ji (種間寺), 35 Kiyotaki-ji (清滝寺)\nWeather: Sunny\nTravel Method: Walking (Train + Bus to and from last walking point)\nDistance: 20.7 km\n=====\nWhile the coffee is brewing I drop a slice of sumomo, sour peach, in my mouth. In the bowl beside the red juicy cuts are yellow ones from the Tosa Buntan, a local pomelo-like fruit. My host brought them over from her parents’ house next door. Her drooping fruit trees had more than she could finish and her eyes lit up when I recognised the fruits.\nIt strikes me how even a single fruit tree can so easily create generosity in people.\nIt’s 4pm, and I’m back from a full day of walking. Sitting in the sunlit living room with its two-storey glass wall, I settle in for a treat: time to write. But back to how the day started.\nI’m up at twilight to enjoy a full breakfast before catching the first bus down to the ferry port, where I finished walking yesterday. The ferry is free for henro to cross the harbour to Temple 33.\nIn the grey light of early morning, I let my thoughts flow with the opaque waters of the harbour as the ferry backs away from the dock.\nI start to think I’m a bit crazy. Why does someone who doesn’t believe put so much effort into such trouble? Not poetry, but I keep going. I wonder why as a non-believer, I bother following the rituals at all. A feeling of importance compels me. Or perhaps, my desire to follow them makes them significant. What significance it has, I don’t know.\nThe stream of consciousness turns sharply; I notice how relaxed I am, how I let the morning sleepiness linger. Today, I don’t need to be alert and thinking about the next food or sleeping spot. I don’t even have a backpack. It never occurred to me how relaxing just changing one factor, a place to return to, could be. It’s as if I’d absentmindedly dropped my urban habits somewhere in the past week.\nSo much has changed since I crossed into Kochi Prefecture, since I left Shishikui and the other henro, Aurelie. Today, I’m supposed to meet up with her and overnight at Temple 35’s tsuyado. This promise overcame my temptation to stay an extra day in my AirBnB flat to read, cook, and chill.\nThe ferry arrives on the other shore in no time and the commuters disappear quickly down the road. I take my time as Sekkei-ji’s temple office won’t be open before 7am.\nWhen I arrive, the sun has just climbed above the temple walls. It’s still cool, and the grounds serenely quiet. This is a Zen temple, one of the only three among the Shikoku 88 Temples, which are of the Shingon Sect. Although it was founded by Kukai, it was switched in the late 16th Century when a monk named Geppo took over as abbot. I search for differences in the altar, but don’t know enough to pick any out. Zen and Shingon are in entirely different branches of Buddhism. Shingon is one of the only surviving branches of Vajrayana, Esoteric or Tantric, Buddhism, in East Asia. It shares roots with Tibetan Buddhism. This type of Buddhism is passed down orally by monks and is mysterious even to its followers.\nZen/Chan Buddhism is a branch of Mahayana Buddhism, which dominates East Asia. Chan originated out of China in the Tang Dynasty and arrived in Japan around the same time as Shingon. Zen has since rooted itself deeply into Kyoto culture, and was further popularised by the ruling samurai class during the shogunate periods. Theravada Buddhism, the oldest branch, is found in South-East Asian countries such as Thailand, Myanmar, and Cambodia.\nThe story behind this temple seems to reflects a historical refrain. Places of significance are not the unyielding bastions of tradition, but rather the sites for adaptation and appropriation. Why did the abbot switch sects? Or why was he elected despite being from a different sect? Did faith, politics, or perhaps community need, factor in? Who decided that it was still worth including in this Pilgrimage?\nI get a temple stamp for a Buddhist magazine back in Hong Kong. In addition to prominent Buddhist thought leaders, they feature inspiring community people from all religious and non-religious backgrounds in their profiles.\nAfter this, the last pockets of urbanity fall away as I follow a road between two foothills. Right where the bend becomes single-lane, a lady stops her pickup truck beside me and thrusts a packaged bun through the open window.\n‘O-settai! For breakfast!’ She says cheerily in a thick accent, her leather face wrinkling with a smile. Then, she hurries along to not block the traffic.\nThis tuna bun I’d never normally buy tastes delicious on a growling stomach. I munch away while trying to locate the henro-no-michi (the henro’s path). The trusty henro stickers usually stuck on sign posts and walls are spaced out today and I frequently have to reconsult my maps.\n It’s only 9am by the time I light my incense at Tanema-ji.\nEven as I go through the ritual motions and scan the newly renovated hall, my mind’s eye sees the breakfasts I had in undergraduate residence and fill with all my memories of the friend I’m dedicating the temple to. During the long, solitary days, memories of people keep me company. They play so vividly I forget myself, just a walking collection of memories.\nIt’s a good place to dwell.\nI hear a smooth, childlike laugh but in an adult’s voice, a line of retort. More laughter. This repeats as I float mentally from dining halls, to our dorm rooms, to the house she now lives in and the car she drives to pick me up. Her laugh ricochets in my memory.\nBefore I go to the office to get a temple stamp for her, I leave the incense holder that I’d picked up at Temple 26 for someone else. Everything in life is borrowed. When that thought lodges deep into your system, it becomes much easier to give things away.\nAfter getting the temple stamp, I ask the monk at the counter whether a French girl has gone by. He hasn’t, so I write a message and ask him to pass it on.\nA quick calculation tells me that if Aurelie is not ahead, then she’s likely not left Shishikui at all. But it doesn’t matter. I’ve grown used to walking alone and enjoy the exchanges with locals as a daily dose of socialising and language practice.\nOutside the gate, I finish the yomogi daifuku I bought yesterday under a shady bench. The heat keeps me perpetually on the verge of hunger, but unable to eat large amounts. With a lighter grocery bag, I set off for my final temple of the day, my enthusiasm fuelling a brisk pace. It’s 9:30 and my day is going to end before noon if I keep this up!\nHowever, by the time I cross the Niyodo River to enter Tosa City, the heat has evaporated my energy. There’s no cover in this flatland. You could bake a pizza on the concrete road. The heat has gotten to the soles of my runners, which were coming off for the nth time.\nFor now, a quick superglue application fixes the problem, but I need to find a new pair soon. Please, just make it to Matsuyama (the next big city after 200+ km). Walking like this makes you talk to your belongings a lot.\nI take refuge in a Lawson on the edge of town and have an early lunch before climbing up the hill to Kyotaki-ji. It’s a good opportunity to check up on my bus times to go back to Kochi using the Japanese app Yahoo!乗換案内.\nAfter refuelling and ample procrastinating, I muster the will to venture back out into the heat. It never gets easier does it? On the one day I don’t have a backpack, there’s insane heat. Or rather, thankfully I don’t have a backpack in this weather.\nI make my way for the complex nestled in the foothills just outside the settlements around the river basin. The houses and two-story buildings retreat as I cross the highway into the fields. Those give way to country houses as the road curves up.\nJust as I head into the shade of the trees for the climb, I hear a motorbike and someone shouting. A guy with a scooter stops beside me and asks if I’m going up to Kiyotaki-ji.\nYes, I am.\n‘It’s really hot!’ He seems breathless from the effort of speaking.\n‘Ah, well I have no choice!’\nHe dangles a plastic bag at me. ‘You’ll need this!’\nI finished an entire bottle in two gulps earlier and didn’t think to buy another in my overheated stupor. Whatever I drank has already gone straight out of my pores. He doesn’t leave, so I ask, ‘Are you going up to Kiyotaki-ji too?’\nHe fishes in his pocket and finally produces a 500 Yen coin. ‘I’m sorry, I don’t have food for you too! There aren’t many henro during this time of year so I wasn’t prepared.’ Despite my initial refusals, he hands me the coin and goes back down the slope. I feel the hard touch of ice through the plastic bag; it seems he came up just to deliver this.\nTouched, I pocket the coin. I’ve begun to write down every o-settai I receive. It feels like an accumulating group effort. I want to remember every person’s contribution. Giving o-settai to a pilgrim is equal to giving to Kobo Daishi, who accompanies every pilgrim on the journey. Economically, the people of Shikoku don’t have much to give, but they give what they can. What they give is usually exactly what I need.\nBy the time I reach the temple and open the Aquarius bottle, it’s half melted and the perfect temperature. The bottle is worth only a few minutes work on salary, but purchasing power can never buy this feeling of deep gratitude for every frigid gulp.\nHow little we value the food that we eat. How much do we pay for services instead?\nIf I were in the city, I’d be scandalised if a carrot jumped from 30 to 60 cents, or if this bottle were 180 instead of 120 Yen. Yet, I wouldn’t give a second thought to paying for delivery for convenience, a new app for my phone, or a plummer to unclog the drain. Now, with a life stripped down to walking, eating, and sleeping, I can feel the full effect of the things that go into my body to keep it going: water and food, especially the local, fresh, tasty, nutritious produce. I wish the world rewarded those who produced good, honest, produce better.\nRehydrated, I survey the courtyard of Kiyotaki-ji, which has noticeable quirks. There is a Western clock in the middle of the courtyard and the line-up of the Main Hall, Daishi Hall, and an additional hall side by side. There is also a huge statue of Yakushi Nyorai, the Medicine Buddha, in the courtyard. The entire assortment seems accidental, but works in its own funky way.\nI perform the rituals for a friend who is working tenaciously to become a practicing lawyer in the United Kingdom. We met at a dinner right after he moved to London and before I moved out and instantly clicked over our nomadic lives and we’ve remained in touch across all our moves. I almost wish I’d taken my stuff to stay at this temples’ overnight tsuyado and watch tomorrow’s sunrise. But, I have a house tonight back in Kochi City, so I let go of the scene and walk past the serene temple garden to get the nokyocho. The lady who writes it for me is pleased as I list off the things I’m enjoying about this prefecture. Like the temple before, I ask her if she’s seen a French henro, and get a negative. Instead, she hands me caramel popcorn and a local CD collection to take away. I feel like I’ve overloaded on o-settai for the day.\nWith today’s temples finished, I head back into town to catch the bus back to Kochi City. I fall asleep and clumsily rush out when the driver calls me from the front. Once off, the trams going past, the covered arcade behind me, the department store, and steady stream of cars take me aback. It’s a small city, but has a vitality and variety that contrasts with the ghostly villages I’ve been passing all week. I take full advantage and pick up some coffee before hopping back on another bus home.\nOnce back, it feels like I’m starting the day again. Six hours before sleeping is plenty to chill, make dinner, take a bath, do laundry, and even read.\nI go to sleep feeling like it’s the start of a new chapter tomorrow. Kochi City is behind me, and ahead lies the long road to the southern tip of Shikoku: Cape Ashizuri and Temple 38.\n"});index.add({'id':18,'href':'/book/docs/Diary-Entries/day-13/','title':"Day 13 - July 3",'section':"Diary Entries",'content':"=====\nKochi City (高知市) → Susaki Henro Hut (須崎遍路小屋)\nTemples: 36 Shōryū-ji (青竜寺)\nWeather: Cloudy with Sun\nTravel Method: Walking + Boat\nDistance: 21 km\n=====\nToday is a series of unfortunate events, but it started off beautifully.\nI get up early to enjoy breakfast before leaving my Airbnb house. This is my chance to eat a full spread unlike the usual onigiri and snacks that I have on the go. I go all out with almond butter toast, banana and maple syrup, soy milk, coffee, and the last of yesterday’s hearty miso soup.\nWith a full belly, I hop on a bus back to where I finished yesterday. I’m eager to continue down Kochi’s solitary coastline. I’ve appreciated the comforts of this urban centre, but I am already beginning to feel trapped and restless. Today’s route will be a good to walk along the sea, with just my thoughts for walking company.\nWhen I get off the bus an hour out of the city, I’m back in flatland filled with fields and solitary houses with gurgling open irrigation channels, neither entirely rural nor urban. A car runs slowly beside me then stops a block ahead. Out skips a guy who rummages through his trunk. As I approach, he fishes a 1000 Yen bill out of his wallet, apologizing for not having any snacks on hand.\nIt’s easy to accept snacks and drinks as osettai, but accepting money just seems … different. But I know I can’t refuse so I just thank him, a bit flustered and forget to give him an osamefuda, a nameslip, before he drives off.\nWhen I turn onto the main route heading out of the town, the houses are reduced to the occasional sentinel along the road. The next town of Usa is on the other side of the hills and along the coast. I’m only 12 kilometres away from Shōryū-ji, the last temple in this cluster of short walks. I want to get it over with quickly so that I can take the ferry across the inlet after before sunset.\nMy body has recovered after two days of shoulder rest and a soft bed, and makes light work crossing the hills. I’ve grown used to the perpetual beads of sweat that accumulate above my lips and forehead. Wiping every few minutes has become reflexive.\nI make my way cautiously down the mountain, using my staff to ease the weight from my terrible knees. I’m also terrified of rolling my ankles on the uneven slope.\nI’m making good time and pass the forest, the fields, and the houses laid out on a grid before reaching the sea wall. My shoulder is aching again, and the masses of concrete offer no worthwhile distraction. Just then, I see a Family Mart down the road, and use it as motivation to keep going. I grit my teeth, frustrated that my shoulder has already broken down again.\nOnce inside the Family Mart, I get my food, plant myself at the eating area and bask in the AC. I have time to sit. Walking 20 kilometres every day no longer seems like much, but in actual practice it is still a daily negotiation between what my feet want to do (walk far, fast), and what my shoulders can handle (go slow, with frequent breaks).\nReluctantly, I get up an hour later. All that’s left is crossing the harbour bridge and following the peninsula bend to Temple 36. It should be about an hour if all goes well.\nEverything goes badly minutes later. I’m sitting on the curb. Pain. Left ankle. Blood on my knees. I’ve rolled my ankle crossing the road – and the culprit is the single rock on a smoothly paved road.\nThe cars don’t even slow down as they drive around me. Really? What happened to friendly Shikoku people? And I’m an obvious henro, with hat, staff, heavy bag and all!\nI roll my ankle tentatively, ignoring the fresh, dull ache and checking the damage. I just got out of the Family Mart. Should I limp back and get ice? Now, it looks so far.\nI’m really pissed. Pissed at my carelessness, at the stupidity.\nI sit on the curb, sitting out the anger and regret, knowing it’s no use, knowing that things happen when I let my guard down. Knowing these facts don’t dampen the fury. So I sit, letting the rage run its course.\nAfter about 10 minutes, I tentatively stand up to test my foot. Just a numb and tense feeling. That’s a good start.\nThe bridge over the bay has transformed from a 10-minute speed walk into a monolith. I’m grateful for my staff as I heave my way up, thrusting my left weight on it. I wonder if I’ll even make it back, if I’ll regret not icing it. Still, something draws me on. Or maybe it’s just a perverse penance for stupidity.\nThe inlet is grey today, grey as the block buildings scattered around the shoreline, grey as the chipped and scratchy concrete.\nWhen I finally make it down the rampart, it feels like an hour’s passed. And…the sole of my shoe is coming off again. By now, I’ve resigned to a numbness and open my backpack for the super glue. It isn’t there. It’s surprising how easily the little pile of things-gone-wrong can mount up. I just spread my belongings systematically onto the pavement, checking the small bags for the orange stick. None.\nAfter repacking, I check the top compartment again, just in case. And it’s there. Sigh of relief. Another 15 minute set-back, but I’m just grateful I can continue walking.\nI hurry on to Temple 36. I thought it was facing the sea, but every turn without a temple shakes my confidence. There isn’t time for getting lost. I speed walk on, map in one hand and staff in the other as my replacement leg.\nEventually, I pass a hot spring hotel on the map. I’m close, I think. I enter the small alley behind and ask two elderly ladies for directions. I speed off in the direction they point in and shout my thanks.\nFinally, hidden behind the folds of the hills, I see it, I think. Actually, the Main Hall is hidden above a steep flight of stone stairs, so steep I wonder if shorter people from prior centuries had to crawl up. Perhaps that was the intention.\nUp at the top, I make quick prayers and rush back down for the temple stamp. As I struggle to put my backpack back on in a comfortable position, the lady sitting on the far bench gets up to help me. This small gesture feels like a reprieve from the past hour of mishaps. I’m glad to have something good to dwell on.\nI head back, around the bends, over the bridge, and into the shuttered town. It feels drained, of life, of purpose. The buildings have gutted doors and windows, the streets invaded by small weeds. The shipyards are empty. I see visions of ghosts of ships cutting through the calm waters, docking, off-loading their catches, the gruff shouts and banter of people no longer here. I was originally going to overnight here, but I’m glad to move on.\nA middle-aged man points behind an unmarked processing warehouse to me: that’s the ferry port. It’s the dock under a cut-out in the tsunami barricade.\nI’m early. I can stretch and nap, but I can’t get the only thing I actually needed: food. I wish I’d gotten something extra at the Family Mart or gone back for ice. I fight off the temptation to catalogue my regrets today. There are too many in the past hours.\nWhen the boat arrives, I’m the only passenger. After I climb in, I notice the outlet and ask the driver if I can charge my phone, which is dying. He says go ahead, I log the small victory, and soon doze off as he zig-zags across the inlet from port to port along Uranouchi Bay.\nHalf way through the ride, I realise my cell phone wasn’t charging because the cable was loose. After pushing it back in, I try to stay awake to watch the sombre hills for the remainder of the ride. I look overboard at the lines we’re carving out in the dark water. On the shore, single houses mushroom here and there. I try not to dwell on the fact that I only have about 20 minutes to charge.\nI ask the driver to take me to Sakauchi, the last port. He asks me if I meant Yokonami, the second last stop where all the henro get off.\nScrew what the other henro do. I just want to call it a day, and start again tomorrow. I confirm my request, despite his concerned look. ‘There’s nothing there,’ he tries again.\n‘There is a camping ground!’ I say cheerfully, even though I don’t want to be setting up a tent in an open, exposed, lonely clearing.\nWe arrive at the port on time. There’s only a locked community building. This wasn’t the camping site I’d hoped for, and I reluctantly head up the hill. On the map, I realise the Yokonmi and Sakauchi are actually the same distance from the henro hut I’m going to, and it would have been better to get off in town. Another mistake in the bucket.\nI’m exhausted, and the thought of no dinner is even more exhausting. The dark houses and boarded up shops that keep emerging and falling away continually dangle me on the faint hope of food. Even the single open gas station didn’t have any. I wish I could sulk, but here it wouldn’t bring people, or help, or comfort. Sulking only works with people. No wonder hermits are so serene.\nInstead, I muster everything I have to keep going, whatever takes my mind off my throbbing left foot, the needles in my right, the tight calves, the caving shoulder, the sweat-drowned back and butt. Sometimes I focus on the henro hut as a beacon, other times I use my anger at myself to keep going. All flames are good flames for survival until tomorrow.\nWhy am I doing this again? The novelty has worn off. This is normal now. Normal, and uncomfortable. Like every other normal life I’ve tried and dropped, I don’t have an answer. But unlike the other times, this feels right. Even today, even the list of mistakes, somehow, feels right. Underneath the fatigue and anger, I sense a fragile, but deep, peace.\nJust past 6:00pm, I emerge into a small enclave of houses as the valley begins to widen. A severe-looking obaa-san (grandmother) greets me as she walks by, speaking in thick dialect. Eventually, I understand she’s asking me where I’m stopping tonight and I tell her I’ll be doing nojuku at the henro hut.\nHer initial surprise turns to weathered disapproval. ‘There are lots of insects!!’\nI almost want to laugh. That’s the least of my worries.\n‘Mosquitos! Do you have mosquito incense?’\n‘No, but I have spray.’ I gesture it. ‘Daijoubu.’ I’ll be fine.\nShe makes a face, tells me it’s not far and reminds me to greet the neighbours upon arrival.\nA few minutes later, it’s the hut itself. There’s a large square platform enough to fit three to four people. Just as I’d read, there is an outlet and light. There’s a weathered 2015 calendar, a sign that says we can use the portable toilet on the driveway of the house and the outside sink.\nAs I wash my hands, legs and face with a towel, a silver-haired man comes out to the garden to water the plants. He takes a glance at me and continues watering the plants and placing bread in the bird feeders. It’s like walking into a hobbit garden left to the wilds.\n‘Excuse me! I’ll be staying in the henro hut tonight. Yoroshikuonegaishimasu!’ In this case, it means ‘I’m indebt to you.’\nHe grunts and gives me a nod. ‘Dozo.’ Go ahead.\nBlunt, matter-of-fact generosity. I like it. After walking all day, I’m relieved to have my own space. Back at the henro hut, I set up the tent and mosquito net. I need to do it fast as the grey skies brings dusk an hour early. After that, I scavenge my remaining snacks for dinner. It needs to last until tomorrow’s breakfast. Thankfully, I’m not that hungry.\nI peel off my socks, and do one more walk to the sink to wash my tired feet. It’s been a day. A very, long day, but I got through it, as we get through every day.\nI drop thoughts into my notebook.\n I walk faster now. I’m pleased with that. Every step is your step. There is no gaining anything in walking. Whatever you go up, you must come down.\nWalking is so different from cycling. Climbing hills are harder on bikes, sometimes impossible, but the thought of sailing down makes the struggle up worthwhile. Some hills are too steep to tackle on a bike without training. Not so with walking. Untrained, you could walk anywhere less than 90-degree inclines; it’s just a matter of time. But, with walking, there’s no cruising. There’s only forward.\nExposure to weather. Heat. Stuffiness. Rain. Cold draft. Everything.\nBut already I’m TOO TIRED TO WRITE. Every night. Cleaning. Dirty. Need to sleep.\n With that, I crawl into my tent. Through the tent flap, the night is a shifting curtain of black, red, and white as cars swish by. This is a luxury hut, but even so, the wooden boards, the stiff position to keep pressure off my twisted left ankle, the car noise, the silence, the scratching noises in the darkness, keep my mind alert. I drift with my eyes closed, thoughts floating, scattering with every new sound.\nNoise. Human voices. I ignore it, thinking it’s the neighbours talking. Then, I realise they’re calling me, so I fumble outside. Two floating faces are lit against the darkness. It’s the obaa-san from earlier, and the ojii-san from the house. They gush a slew of sentences.\nI can’t process. I see the familiar green coils and a metal disk container. Oh, godsend mosquito incense! I accept their offer and light two: one at the edge of the platform and one I stick inside my tent. The risk of burning a hole is worth it to keep the mosquitos away from my ears.\nThe rest of the night, I sleep lightly, half in a smoke-induce daze, and half waiting for something to come at me from the bushes behind the hut walls.\n"});index.add({'id':19,'href':'/book/docs/Diary-Entries/day-14/','title':"Day 14 - July 4",'section':"Diary Entries",'content':"=====\nSusaki Henro Hut 須崎遍路小屋 → Agiri Kubokawa Michi-no-Eki アギリ窪川道の駅\nTemples: None\nWeather: Rain\nTravel Method: Walking + Train\nDistance: 18.7 (+ 19) km\n=====\nI wake up to a morning drizzle and check my foot. It’s still the size of a golfball, but curiously not an angry purple.\nI’m lucky. A millimetre off and I would probably be back in Kochi City, in the hospital. I stop myself from looping yesterday’s fall in my head, from thinking about that one fateful moment, that one avoidable step.\nUnlucky enough to learn a lesson, but lucky enough to survive it.\nI snack on the remaining genpi for breakfast. At least I have breakfast. Yesterday, I hadn’t thought to buy food in the last town. Maybe the two days in the city have made me complacent.\nWhen done, I take down my tent slowly. I think it’ll be a while before I can set it up so snugly in a hut again. I clean up and pack my bags. The last things to be packed are my phone and spare battery, which are balanced on the beams above where the two outlets in the hut are. I find out my phone didn’t charge overnight. One of the cables works and the other is choppy. I should have checked last night before tucking in. Yet another lapse in vigilance.\nI have a habit of forgetting things and producing small mistakes, routinely needing to go back and correct things. These little errors on a busy work schedule were minor irritations that I’d learned to work around by finishing things earlier and doing more checks. That’s when I worked in offices, could blame a busy schedule and had time to erase mistakes. Now, I don’t have 20 things on my plate, just the handful of daily tasks like charging my phone where possible. You don’t charge batteries earlier to do a better charge later. The walking, nojuku, henro life is less like a take-home exam and more like a pass-fail one.\nOnce I’m done chiding myself, I let it go. One of these days, the lesson will sink in, or it won’t. Actually, I don’t really need the phone. It’s a fairly straight-forward route down the coast.\nI set off, eager to get a proper breakfast in the town just a few kilometres away.\nAlmost immediately after setting out, I roll on my right foot too. Sigh.\nIt’s not too serious, so I can think that life has its sense of humour by being fair to both sides of my feet. Perhaps I’ve gone a bit insane. I smile as I continue past a scattering of fields and houses. Then, there’s a massive, grey power plant that almost seems as large as the surrounding hills. It seems so jarring, but if I wasn’t walking through, I wouldn’t have noticed, even though this is what powers places for miles around.\nI arrive at the supermarket in Susaki City just before it opens. It’s begun to rain again, so I hang around the covered entrance along with one or two other early birds. When we’re finally let in, I go up and down the isles for breakfast inspiration, feasting my eyes on the options. Eventually, I end up with far too much: maki rolls, yogurt, cheese cubes, bread, cereal. Feast after famine.\nI settle down in the eating. It’s simple food, but my taste buds lap up every morsel of soy sauce-dipped cucumber rolls. When I’m done, I nurse a cup of hot coffee in my hands. It’s summer, but I have the chills. It’s a cocktail mix of sweat-soaked clothes, AC, and lack of food. I eye the dark curtains in the skies on the other side of the glass wall. Rain is coming.\n When I follow the road leaving Susaki City, it’s raining in earnest. The rhythmic thuds on my umbrella are loudest; next are the silver pellets on concrete, and every minute a car sends a violent wooosh. I’m focusing on angling my umbrella perfectly so that it covers my cloth runners. They will get wet, but since I will be doing nojuku again tonight, I’d like to delay the process as long as possible.\nI finally admit, this is ugly weather and look for cover.\nAt 13:25, I am breathless at the train platform of Awa station.\nI’ve just missed the 13:21 train, even though I’d arrived in the village at around 12:45. Thinking I had time, I went to the Lawson to try to get WiFi and shelter from the rain. It was only at 13:20 that I realised I’d miscalculated the train schedule.\nI raced back down the road, hoping for a miracle.\nIt’s a single-track platform, and after waiting for some 15 minutes, I watch the train from the opposite direction pull up, exactly on time.\nMy next train is 4:50pm. I have four hours to kill in the middle of nowhere. On a sunny day, it’s enough time to walk to the station that I would have gotten off at. On a rainy day, I’m not braving the slippery mountain paths with a twisted left ankle.\nIt would have been fine if I’d just arrived late. But no, I’d arrived early, and went to the Lawson instead of checking the station.\nI’m muted with fury. With nothing to explode at, it burrows deep into my chest. I box the rage, cover my face, and take a nap. I’m tired, and I’m going to make this count with a good nap.\nI finally get up at 4pm, feeling drowsy from rest. At night, I don’t sleep well when I camp out because the alien noises in the darkness keep my imagination going, whereas the noises of the day are familiar and I can relax.\nI stare out at the deserted beach. The cliffs on either side wrap it into a crescent shape with small grey islands on the horizon. The finches have been chirping and zipping everywhere, circling between the bent palm trees and the station platform, completely unperturbed by the rain. It’s actually a pretty beach, even in bleak weather.\nTime passes. It always does. Another 40 minutes to go.\nI got the hang of waiting after I started backpacking. I manage having nothing to do. I can live with being wet. I can live with regrets, like missing this train. There’s a TEDTalk about regret that explained how we feel it more acutely when we are that much closer to what we could have had, when we can easily imagine having done otherwise, to get another outcome. How true. Regrets are starting points from which to learn. I can live with mistakes. I’m still learning to live with the stupidity that causes avoidable mistakes.\nI’m a bit surprised at how quickly I accepted my predicament. It’s a strange, but pleasant feeling. It’s like a calmness has attached like lichen and sits quietly in a corner even when I am possessed with my fury earlier. It nudged me to sleep off my exhaustion and worked its magic.\nNow I sit here, waiting out the last 30 minutes with a more rested body, a slightly weathered mind, but pretty whole.\n I get off the train at Kageno station and set out for the last time in the downpour. The angry clouds bring nightfall early, and I need to get to the next Michi-no-Eki for both food and tonight’s shelter.\nFocus on the steps. Left-right, left-right. The umbrella at just that angle. Head down and looking ahead to avoid the numerous puddles. I know what a 5.5 km/hr pace feels like now. It doesn’t come naturally, so all I can do is focus on steady breathing, willing my feet in a steady march, keeping umbrella hand, and avoiding the cars that race by with waves of water sailing onto the sidewalk.\nOne intense walking hour later, I arrive at the edge of Kubokawa town, where there is a Lawson and the Michi-no-Eki. The first thing I do is buy a bottle of water and chug. It takes a few minutes before it quenches my thirst, and I wait by going online again. I’ve been able to connect more often than I’d expected, which has helped me plan for a factor I hadn’t considered before starting — the weather. Now, it’s the first thing I want to know. Then I go down the list of things to check: the route or transit, my walking data, then messages.\nI go to the empty Michi-no-Eki across the street for a real dinner. It’s summer, but a bowl of hot udon in soup is perfect for remedying my chills. Speed walking in the summer rain just means being wet inside and out, and literally head to toe. I savour every noodle individually and cup the still-hot bowl afterwards. After that, I just wait until the restaurant closes, as I’m charging my phone and my spare battery at this strategic corner table.\nWhen I head out again, I pick a bench flanked by two posts along the walkway to prop up my tent and hang my mosquito net. It would have been easier to just lie down on the bench and call it a day, but the mosquitos are already coming.\nThere’s a solitary man on the other wing of the plaza watching me and it gives me the creeps. I’m glad I have my sedge hat on, so it’s difficult for him to figure out much about me. Aside from him, this place feels like a good nojuku spot. It’s got modern architecture, plenty of nice modern washrooms outside, has WiFi, and steady traffic on the main road.\nI climb under my orange flap and gingerly adjust my essentials, which double up as my pillow. I lie flat on my back so that the weight distributes properly across the wooden beams of the bench. Wooden benches have their degrees of comfort, and this is on the better end.\nI get a message. It’s from a friend I was considering for tomorrow’s temple, Iwamoto-ji. She hadn’t messaged in almost two weeks.\nThe message reads, ‘I’ve cut my hair!’\nI guess that confirms the next one’s for her.\n"});index.add({'id':20,'href':'/book/docs/Diary-Entries/day-15/','title':"Day 15 - July 5",'section':"Diary Entries",'content':"=====\nAgiri Kubokawa Michi-no-Eki アギリ窪川道の駅 –\u0026gt; Kubokawa 窪川\nTemples: 37 (Iwamoto-ji 岩本寺)\nWeather: Rain\nTravel Method: Walking\nDistance: 18.7 km\n=====\nMy alarm goes off and I reluctantly unzip my tent flap, poke my head out, and sit up on the bench.\nCleaning up, packing, having breakfast, chugging half of the two-litre bottle to offload weight fill up my first hour. Whether I rush or take my time, I’ve discovered don’t stray far from this hour mark.\nWith the routine complete, we set off. Me, myself, and my thoughts.\nI have a lot on my mind as I walk into town.\nThe most immediate is how far to walk today. My original plan was to stop at Kageno station last night after 30 kilometres of walking. Since I took the train, I’ve gotten further by doing less. Instead of arriving at Iwamoto-ji, Temple 37, by noon today, I’ll be there by 9am latest. It should be a happy problem, but the point of all this was the walking. I’m caught between waiting 5 hours for my host to pick me up or walking some more.\nJust after leaving the michi-no-eki, an oncoming truck roars over a pool of water beside me. I’m taken aback by how inconsiderate it is. Being drenched, again, already, has become a routine inconvenience. But I keep walking and return to my thoughts.\nIf I have time, why not continue walking? I weigh the choices. Practically speaking, it shaves 10 out of 80-odd kilometres to Temple 38 and spaces out my daily camping spots better. From a principles perspective, I should just walk my 20-kilometre quota today as well. This reflects discipline. I am in the Dojo of Ascetic Training, after all.\nBy now the sleepy, grey drizzle is getting earnest, and I unfold my umbrella, glancing up regularly to get a sense of the road.\nPoints against would be that I still have a swollen ankle, that I should rest, that it’s raining today, and that, philosophically, there is no rush.\nI guess the decision rests on my motives, which I now realise adversity is transforming into meaning. I started the Ohenro because it checked all the boxes: being in Japan, in a rural area, with plenty of exercise, going from place to place, cheaply, safely, without excessive planning, with a simple and flexible route, not needing to talk, and a new experience to experiment on myself. Everything else I would discover was just bonus. Meaning was a bonus. Because it checked off all the boxes at the time, I didn’t prioritise the reasons.\nWhen we have to make decisions, we prioritise. Now, I have about two hours to work out my priorities. Our actions reflect priorities, which in turn are manifestations of principles. I’m afraid of what stopping early would reveal about me. Yet, I’m also unconvinced that walking further would ‘prove’ anything either. Principles are manifested in action. They are the cause, the result, and even the by-product. They give what we do meaning, whether we take responsibility for that or not.\nThis decision doesn’t matter in the grand scheme of things. It just happens to matter to me.\nBy now, the winding main road has entered parallel streets. I’m at the edge of town. I pull out my phone to figure out the fastest route to the train station. Once there, I look through the printed train schedule. Principles are a good start, but logistics make things happen. I need to make sure I can train back if I walk further.\nIt’s a downpour by the time I’m done. The temple is only a few blocks away, so I try to persist down the main street. Within minutes, the entire town disappears behind a cascade, so I take cover at a corner shop.\nI listen to the rain, which has always had a soothing effect. If it weren’t for wet shoes, summer rain is quite romantic. Raindrops splinter like crystals and the notes on corrugated metal roofs, broad leaves, and concrete roads form mellow symphonies.\n‘Hey!’ A voice shouts from behind. I turn around to find a scruffy grandfather henro covered by a clear poncho. I smile, here’s another crazy one. We stand almost shoulder to shoulder and shout over the rain. He tries to offer me the poncho, which I would have killed for, but I can’t conscience leaving him without one. Eventually, our conversation peters out and he heads off. His solitary form is outlined by a silver mantle, his plastic sheet serving as adamantium against the rain.\nWhen the heavy rain lightens, I head down the final blocks.\nIwamoto-ji was founded by Gyoki, but is now a collection of six temples after Kukai added five temples with a deity each. It’s the first one that has a community centre in a modern building. Posters and notices for classes and events are at the entrance. The Main Hall’s ceiling also has community mural with 575 paintings of varying styles and skill levels. Looking at the images, I imagine kids must have contributed, maybe from ladders and a raised platform. I can hear their laughter as the paint drips from their brushes and splatters on someone below.\nUp until a few decades ago, Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines were community hubs, occupied by playing kids, socialising adults, and community events. The temples today have donned new sombre characters as their courtyards have emptied along with the towns they serve. I’m glad to see this one is an exception.\nThe friend who messaged me last night was the one I was considering for this temple, and she loves kids. I’m struck by this coincidence. It is one of many, and I wonder at what subliminal cues had lead to this.\nI said considering. Usually, pilgrims set out on the Ohenro to pray for themselves or their family. Usually, it’s something significant, to be worth the time, financial, and physical investment. I didn’t have anything to wish for, so I decided early on to dedicate each temple to someone, just in case prayers get answered.\nThe first few temples were straight forward because they went to family, seniors, and people I was indebted to. Order reflects priorities, at least in my Chinese mind. The next set were the friends that came to mind, unambiguously. Reflex also reflects importance. Then, I hit Kochi, where the temples thinned out and so did the straight-forward, friendships. Few meaningful relationships are straight-forward. They usually have many goods combined with some significant bads. There are many people I’m grateful to, but am ambivalent about. Walking gives me time to sort that out.\nBy now, I’d seen enough temples to know they had distinct characters and stories that suited specific individuals. Based on a mixture of research and instinct, I earmarked some and left the rest to circumstance. The dedication could be chosen for the route, the view, the history, the ambience, and the timing. Most importantly, I have to be in the right frame of mind to wish that person well by the time I light the incense.\nHere at Iwamoto-ji I realise I might never work it out, but I can still let go and wish someone well. Letting go is easier with understanding, but it’s not necessary. Understanding in and of itself is a good. But letting go is just a choice. Compassion doesn’t require understanding.\nAfter that, I get the nokyocho and charge my phone in the office. Temple 37 is done. Temple 38 is calling from the end of Shikoku, 82 kilometres down the coast. I wait for an hour at Iwamoto-ji and the rain isn’t letting up. The sofas in the community centre were perfect for discrete napping, but one of the monks suggested I go back outside. Sometimes it’s better to beg forgiveness than permission. Sitting at the covered waiting area with soaked feet and clothes, I nap, snack, lay out my wet belongings. Time ambles along, too slowly.\nOnly an hour later do I realise I forgot to switch on the power outlet, and my phone didn’t charge. I left annoyance on the road somewhere the past few days and simply switch it on and head back out to wait until 9:45, the latest before I cannot set out again. Then, I leave my bag at the office to follow the poncho henro further down the coast.\n My phone dies an hour later, just when I realise I’m slower than I thought. I should turn back to be safe. But I hate leaving things unfinished.\nI walk-jog-run the rest of the way down the plateau, spiralling down the hills, trying not to slip on the water overflowing from the drains. At the base, I see the poncho henro sitting in a hut taking a smoke. He waves and we have a quick catch up before I ask him the time and excuse myself.\nAnother half-hour and I arrive at Kuboshi-no-Sato onsen gasping for breath. I ask the reception for the washroom and after that for directions to Kaina Station.\nIt’s not just behind the onsen as it seemed on the map, so I’m running again through a river valley and farmland. At least, the rain has stopped.\nI finally arrive with 10 minutes to spare. Relief. My legs are shaking. I stretch before the train pulls in to the single-track platform.\n Back in Kubokawa, I have time for a quick lunch and go to one of the only two open restaurants. This family-run cafe-bar is of hobbit proportions, just like the silver-haired lady perched on a stool, managing the antique metal karaoke machine. A handful of patrons in spectacles and cardigans are taking the mic in turns, heaving themselves onto a raised lounge area and singing to a small colour television. Eventually, they ask me questions and my answers travel down the row. I finish my fried rice by the window as they cheer and clap for each other.\nWhen I finish, I head back to Iwamoto-ji and it isn’t long before my Airbnb host finds me at the rest area. We click instantly and I take her around the complex, sharing my rudimentary knowledge. The Ohenro appealed because it is open on how people can participate, and early on, I decided mine would be inclusive to old friends and strangers alike. After my host lights her incense, says her prayers, writes her nameslips, and tosses her coins, we head out.\nFirst, it’s a quick grocery trip to pick up breakfast and dinner. Then, we follow the meandering Kubokawa (kawa means river) to her house, with green fields and dark hills floating by outside my window.\nHer house. Her incredible house. Her incredibly old, well-kept, traditional, house. It takes me a while to get over the quality of the wood, the tatami mats, and how smooth the sliding doors are (sign of craftsmanship). The enclosed veranda-walkway is wide, with solid, oiled planks; my sleeping area has a bedroom and sitting area with the family shrine, keepsakes and tea. The kitchen appliances, I’m told, were working when my host moved in after a decade of disuse. Rural Japan is abound with traditional houses. Many are weathered, their beams dry and raw, the attics full of cobwebs, and the toilets still outhouse pits. I’d expected any or all of the above, not this.\nAfter settling in, my host, suggests we go to her favourite onsen at Matsubakawa. An onsen over a river? I’m in!\nBy dusk, I’m perched at the edge of a steaming pool above the Matsuba River, dizzy with exhaustion and replaying the incredible turn of events. I’m so glad I booked the place, but already regret not staying longer. We chat in the pool as other groups of women come in and out. Eventually, we remember dinner and get up.\nThe conversation continues all the way home into the kitchen, where my host whips up a seafood and vegetable pasta – a treat since Shikoku’s wonderful food is limited to local, regional dishes.\nBy now, we’ve covered a range of topics. I learn how she ended up in Japan, and this little town without speaking much Japanese. I am fascinated with her experiences on everything from setting up WiFi to the English teachers who come and go. She tells me of how she found her ‘crazy’ dog, Barie, and the poor state of dog adoption in Japan.\nWe have shared topics such as India and our appreciation for how self-reliant many Japanese farmers and elderly are. Of course, she asks about me as well. The topics of blogging and Instagram come up, and I offer to show her cross-promoting between platforms. That’s when I realise that work tools I’d taken for granted can be useful to people.\nAfter dinner, as we’re figuring out when to leave tomorrow, I finally take up a casual offer she made earlier: can I stay one more night?\n‘Of course.’\nIn Shikoku, it can be that simple.\n"});index.add({'id':21,'href':'/book/docs/Diary-Entries/day-16/','title':"Day 16 - July 6",'section':"Diary Entries",'content':"=====\nSomewhere in Takaoka-gun (高岡郡)\nTemples: None\nWeather: Cloudy + Rain\nTravel Method: None!\nDistance: 0 km\n=====\n ‘Stay’ is a charming word in a friend’s vocabulary. – Louisa May Alcott  Stay has enticed travellers to lay down roots, caused vagabonds to give up their wanders. Mystics and monks in deep jungles and remote mountains entice nomads to become disciples and they never leave their hamlet retreats again. Whether spoken by a life-long friend or a newfound connection, the word has equal power when the stars align. I’ve already encountered it three times in Shikoku. Is it temptation or an invitation?\nI hear the faint thud of footsteps, take a brief glance at the time, and drift back into sleep. When I wake again, my host has left for work.\nI roll off the futon onto the tatami, savouring the luxury of having nowhere in particular to go. The room is almost pitch black, wrapped in a sleepy silence. I check my ankle, which had a cooling patch that my host gave me for the swelling. I open the screen door to the sitting room, and then the one to the hallway. The glare is blinding.\nI go down the hall to the kitchen, help myself to some cereal, yogurt and coffee before planting myself at the table.\nI’m a bit stiff. Now that I’m not on adrenaline, the fatigue sets in. Today, I switch modes. Instead of the usual packing, walking, sweating, looking for food, planning distances, thinking about friends, trying to wipe off a day’s grime with a towel, or setting up a tent – I will sit, drink tea, and type. The accumulated exhaustion, rainy weather, and my period really call for a day off.\nI set up my phone and wireless keyboard. I hope I can switch mental modes. My goal is to finish a blog post with tips on how to become a digital nomad my Couchsurfing host in Awa City, Masashi, inspired during our late night conversation. He dreamed of not only becoming a nomadic professional, but a nomadic family.\nI pull memories of Thailand, Myanmar and Laos, where I was recently working out of a co-working space. Contract work kept me afloat and engaged with my interests while leaving time for my personal projects. A year ago, I worked out of an incredible farmhouse in rural Italy, which was also incredibly cold and under-serviced by Italian telecoms. Attempting to write, I can no longer recall the details or relate to my state of mind then. The old me and the current me seem to be separated by a glass barrier. I’ve changed a lot, but I still feel like an accidental nomad. I try to distill patterns and tips to help Masashi achieve his dream.\nThe whole morning goes by just typing, boiling water, pouring tea, and typing some more. Slowly, but surely, the piece comes together.\nA few hours later, I hear the crunch of gravel on the driveway, followed by ecstatic barking. My host is back for lunch. It’s just as well because I snack all day and forget to eat when working, the the opposite of my henro tendency to always think about food.\n‘How’s your morning been?’ She lets the dog in to see if he behaves. He runs around in circles, hyperactive, trying to get my attention. She recommended that I ignore him and we continue chatting while she warms up the leftover pasta.\nI clear the table and she sits down to eat. One of the things we talk about is the habitat, the agricultural practices, and trying to negotiate between cleanliness and reducing environmental impact. All the dish water flushes straight out into the Kubokawa, which collects all the refuse water from homes and fields. Japan’s agricultural land is the most intensely farmed amongst the developed countries, and 85% of the 2.3 million farms plant rice annually. Rice paddies are drowned in pesticides because the rich soil is has daily weed blooms. This valley is surrounded by rice paddies. All’s not well for the river underneath the surface. Nonetheless, my host somehow managed to find a few local, natural cleaning solutions for mould and shows me the bottle.\nShe’ll be heading out again around 2pm. Would I like her to drop me off somewhere? She can pick me up as well.\nI hum and haw. Luxury is whatever you can’t get enough of. Days in one place are scarce for walking henro.\nI continue working when she goes upstairs to nap. I’m still sitting in the same spot when she leaves. I finally call it a day when she comes back again in the evening.\nWe go to town to grocery shop for Chinese ingredients. I’m cooking tonight as a small gesture of thanks for her hosting me a much-needed extra day. We go around the different produce isles, surveying the options for inspiration before finally deciding. In the end, I decide on prawns cooked Chinese/Thai-style with ginger, green onions, chili flakes, Cantonese tomato-egg-stirfry, stir-fried veggies with ginger, and tofu-mushroom in oyster sauce.\nBack at home I go to work in the kitchen with the two stoves to prepare the dishes. Part of me feels like a fraud when I have friends who could do these dishes with much more practiced efficiency. I rely on intuition from blurred memories, eyeball, and skip between chopping and chatting.\nWhen the dishes are done, we amuse ourselves taking a photo of Du Fu, one of China’s five master Tang poets, sitting serenely between the plates. Transplanting ‘foreign’ dishes suddenly requires explaining the ingredients, the cooking methods, and the resulting flavours, which I was fed before I could even speak. Beyond the processes, these dishes are reflections of fascinating traditions and accidents of history alike.\nThe Thai and Chaozhou cuisines are heavily dependent on fish sauce that come from centuries of trade and cultural mingling; the Chinese wok-cooking creates an entirely different dish with tomato and eggs than the Japanese omu-rice (ketchup omelette rice). Because the ubiquitous Chinese wok never penetrated into Japan like Chinese Tang-style powdered green tea (Japan’s matcha), the Chinese dinner staple of flash-frying veggies with ginger and/or garlic is a foreign concept. I hope my host is at least a little interested in the history. At least I could identify her figurine from the Chinese characters at the bottom and give it significance.\nAs we’re eating dinner, it feels like the day is done. Already I’m thinking again about tomorrow and mentally saying goodbye to this place. This is a lovely 100-year old house that’s well-kept by a lovely Australian who found a perfect fit in this random, middle-of-nowhere place in Japan. We continue chatting long after we’re full. My host’s experiences in India’s ashrams and Japanese bureaucracy are eye-opening. I could listen for hours if I didn’t have to pack.\nSuddenly she asks, ‘How’s your ankle?’\nActually I can’t tell. I’m sure it’s better, but she checks and declares the swelling has gone down significantly. That’s always reassuring. I wonder at how people notice these small changes.\nIt’s early, but I can’t keep my eyelids up anymore. My body has allowed itself to be tired today. I think the thousands of cells inside me have unanimously decided to focus today on mending and healing rather than keeping me energetic. I realise now that the energy I had despite a few hours of broken sleep when camping was my body holding itself together like a dam. Even though I have plenty of problems, like chronic lower back pain, bad knees, a repeatedly injured ankle, and now a torn shoulder, I’m grateful that somehow, it all still functions. I can take being weak as long as I can do the things I want to do.\nBack in my room, I check if my clothes are dry and begin packing my stuff into bags to shove into my backpack tomorrow morning.\nEven though I don’t stay anywhere more than two days, Shikoku is feeling more and more like home. When I finish, only time will tell if this inkling feeling is true. My life seems to go round in circles. People you are meant to meet, you will eventually meet twice in life.\nMatta, ne? Until next time.\n"});index.add({'id':22,'href':'/book/docs/Diary-Entries/day-17/','title':"Day 17 - July 7",'section':"Diary Entries",'content':"=====\nKaina Station → Michi-no-Eki Bios Oogata (道の駅ビオス おおがた) Temples: None\nWeather: Cloudy\nTravel Method: Walking\nDistance: 24.2 km\n=====\nThe day starts early, too unjustly early for a departure. This is a good life, a good home, a good river outside, with good hills.\nWe have breakfast and I pack the last items into my backpack as my host starts the car. Where did the morning go?\nMy host and I have our last good chat on the way to Kubokawa station, where she’ll drop me off on the way to work. The conversation ebbs and flows after we’ve covered so much the past two days. The fleeting nature of travel encounters usually means you discover more than you would with people you see every week, people whom you think you have time to get to know.\nAt the station, I really want a selfie. I’ve always been more interested in taking photos so people looking at them can feel as though they’re there. I never quite understood why people would want to see other people smiling, or why people would stare at the camera for a posed shot. I’ve recently changed my mind. I want to see a reference to a me that I know is changing and disappearing every moment, and read in that younger face the memories and perspectives that may not be what I relate to later. I also want these photos to recall the details of the people who joined me.\nLast year we took a photo with my grandma, my mom, and my siblings and me. The elders had severe, awkward faces uncertain as to whether to show how pleased they were. We kids had broad grins and deep dimples. That’s the first time I remember the three of us with genuine grins for a posed family photo. It captured a side of us I don’t mind looking at more often.\nWhen we finish the photos, she drives off to work while I wait for the train to take me back to my last spot, Kaina station.\n After getting off the train, I follow the road that wraps around the low hills snaking towards the coast. Already, the day is hot and humid, even without the sun. The various bends, slight inclines, and handful of rivers have different hues and characters. The train track follows the hills on the other side of the river. A town takes at least 15 minutes to walk through before the buildings beside the road are completely replaced by dense trees. The landscape changes constantly, but keeps a similar theme of quiet houses, semi-tropical trees, cars here and there, the regular beat of my staff followed by the jiggle of the bell. I have an early lunch at 11am at a michi-no-eki just before I reach the coast again. After examining every item in the shop, I pick out a youkan (red bean sweet stick), bento box, and the usual sticks of sweet genpi that I’ve become addicted to. Here, most items have a familiar samurai mascot, and I find out it is Chōsokabe Motochika, the only person who has ever unified Shikoku. I sit down at the spacious eating area, which only has one or two people.\nOnce done, I follow the coast, tempted constantly to take a ride by the parallel train tracks. It’s a magic carpet that could whizz me to the next town. It’s even more tempting when the tracks turn inward to take a shortcut through the hills into town and I need to walk the extra distance.\nAny space without human habitation seems a bit unsettling, a place without any Plan B. The cars are like hovering Lego blocks just above the sea wall after they pass me. On my left is the blue-black sea clawing against the jagged rocks and cement layers. The air is sticky with salt.\nLooking back behind me, I wonder if those hills are just Misakiyama or Temple #36, where I’d rolled my ankle. How far it alls is seems. How far I’ve come.\nI keep stopping with every rest hut along the way, taking my time. Today feels simultaneously like a short and long walk and it makes me lethargic. Flat concrete road may be easy on the muscles, but it is hard on the feet and knees after a few hours. I’m back in the daily grind of the walking henro life, but my body hasn’t woken up to that reality.\nIt’s in these long stretches of ‘nothing’ that we learn to notice things around us, that we learn to notice ourselves and how we respond to ‘nothing’. Despite the discomfort, I find it soothing. My mind has gone silent.\nAfter what seems like ages, I pass the Ida Tunnel, which is supposed to have a Kanon-ji listed on the nojuku henro list. With this list, which is usually a word and a phrase if you’re lucky, you never know quite what to look for. You just hope it’ll be apparent. Thankfully, the small, well-kept temple with it’s garden is obvious. I head onto the grounds to get a drink from the spring and peak inside at the swept tatami floor with a fan and knick-knacks in the corner. I could stop here today. It looks like a first-class nojuku-spot.\nBut it’s barely 2pm and feels too early to stop, so I just sit at the steps and chill, enjoying the little garden.\nThe town just after it is oddly quiet. There isn’t a soul in sight, even though the billboards, which I haven’t seen in many other towns, suggests that it has some commerce. But this is henro low-season. I am walking alone, like yesterday, and the day before that. Every now and then, self-awareness at that fact erupts.\nWhen the houses are squeezed out by the hill jutting out into the sea, I see another new henro hut on stilts beside a washroom. I keep going, aiming for a Daishido another kilometre or two down the road. I want to stop there tonight and pick up food at the michi-no-eki another kilometre down. I haven’t walked much today, but my shoulder and feet are nagging as usual. I put down my backpack regularly. Even though I’m not sure about the ‘ultimate’ cause amongst the various factors (inappropriate bag, weak body, overweight bag, heat), I’ve just accepted that I need to accommodate it.\nJust before 4pm, I drop my bag onto a bench at the michi-no-eki, greeting a middle-aged female walking henro with an equally large backpack. Seeing her is encouraging. After I pick up food from the shop, we introduce ourselves and I ask her where she’s stopping today.\n‘Nakamura.’ She replies casually. The town is still another 15 kilometres away, and she walked from Kubokawa, the station my host dropped me off at. I’m astounded. All in all, she’s doing 40 kilometres today.\nWhy?\nShe explains that she’s a week-henro, flying in from Tokyo during her vacations to walk a leg. She’s making the most of her trip by going as fast as she can. This time, she wants to reach Cape Ashizuri before returning home.\nThat means another 40 kilometre walk tomorrow. She shrugs it off as a fact of life. There isn’t a trace of smugness or complaint.\nShe will be barely warmed up by the time she finishes, but is almost doubling my daily average. I’m embarrassed. I’m sure she feels all the pains I feel, but it hasn’t gotten to her.\nHer response is, ‘Ma, yukuri, yukuri.’ Take it slowly. Take it easy. After a while, she gets up to continue to her business hotel in Nakamura. She has a few hours extra because she can arrive after nightfall. Maybe that’s another benefit of having a hotel every night.\nAfter she leaves, I go inside to the community centre to charge my phone. My brain automatically thinks about outlets when I stop now, and I don’t know if the Daishido has one.\nJust before 5pm, I retrace a kilometre back to the listed Daishido. I ask the post office across the street whom I should pay my greetings to, but the lady there says it’s not open anymore. I’m disappointed, and I make it obvious. The staff offer to help me book a ryokan instead, but I don’t want to pay again. A younger staff helps me talk to the neighbours and makes a few phone calls asking for the person in charge – everyone seems to know him in this small village. But no luck, he’s not hosting anymore.\nThat’s a huge blow. I’ve wasted two kilometers walking back and forth.\nI have no choice but to trek back to the michi-no-eki and sit at the beach, watching the surfers swim out and ride the waves. It’s nice to have my shoes off and let my eyes follow the small moving figures bob between the waves. I smile at a whimsical Instagram caption: What do you do when you have no room? Chill at the beach, of course. Luxury and/or poverty, interpreted however you will.\nWhen the wind picks up I head to the showers in hope for a quick clean up. Again, I don’t want to pay for a coin shower and soak my already damp clothes while turning it on. So instead, I head back to the michi-no-eki building to figure out where to sleep.\nThere’s another female walking-henro. They’re such a rare breed, two in an afternoon is like a jackpot. Within a few minutes our conversations tilts into English. She’s closer to my age and waiting for her ride to her ryokan tonight. But she has also done nojuku before. I’m impressed, as the Japanese usually don’t believe that local women would ever do such a thing. When her ride comes, we bid each other goodbye, and the closed michi-no-eki begins to feel a little lonely.\nThey say in Japanese, Ichi-go, ichi-e. Every encounter is unique. Take them as they come. Let them go when they end. I’m glad it happened. Maybe this isn’t the end, but just an end.\nI try in vain to set up my tent against a wall, just covering the bench beside it, but the concrete floor offers nowhere to put my spikes. Eventually, I just crawl under a table and sleep with the mosquito net and the tent as a blanket. Simple solution. It’s warm enough anyway.\nYou take what you get. I’m lucky to fit.\n"});index.add({'id':23,'href':'/book/docs/Diary-Entries/day-18/','title':"Day 18 - July 8",'section':"Diary Entries",'content':"=====\nMichi-no-Eki Bios Oogata (道の駅ビオス おおがた) → Shimonokae (下ノ加江)\nTemples: None\nWeather: Cloudy + Rain\nTravel Method: Walking\nDistance: 28 km\n=====\nLast night was meh. That sound synthesises a relatively comfortable spot (under a table), feeling comfortable (mostly not too hot or cold), a full belly (from snacks), general feeling of safety (could see incoming traffic), and a decent 8 hours of sleep (broken).\nAfter forcing myself to sleep despite the sheen of sweat on my forehead, I drifted awake when the cool air sank in. The two hours before dawn are chilliest. The blackness and cold have reached their maturity. It’s often only when the horizon materialises that I drift back to sleep for another hour or so.\nAll too soon, I hear foot steps, voices, and the scrape of metal along the pavement. I see feet and hands setting up the shop. Shaking off a foggy haze, I crawl out from under my table at 6:00am feeling like I’m late.\nThe concrete surrounding me is dark, soaked from last night’s rain. The bench I’d originally tried to sleep on is wet too. I’m glad I used my size to my advantage last night.\nI snack on the genpi I’d bought yesterday for breakfast. I’ll have to get a proper breakfast later. Soon, it’s 7:00am, so I get going.\nThe route has a steady procession of houses and shops. The steady traffic is squeezed into two lanes. Whatever you’re carrying, truck deliveries, yourself, your produce, your kids, you go down the same path laid out between the temperamental sea and the rugged hills.\nI stop at the first convenience store along the the way for a second breakfast and check for weather and status updates. You take what you get when you get it in Kochi. Sure enough, soon after leaving it the hills fold tighter until only the road is left following a river gathering morning mist.\nI follow the bends, thinking, not thinking. An outpost of wooden houses appears. The first one reminds me of the settler houses in the New World. The sign outside reads ‘home-roasted coffee’ in Japanese.\nI’m intrigued. It’s 9:00am, and I should be hurrying into Nakamura to clean up in an onsen and stock up on food. Coffee is a frivolous distraction, and I’ve been taking lots of little breaks already. Yet, this little bastion of coffee culture warrants investigation.\nA bell tinkers as I push open the door into a pristine logger’s cabin with well oiled boards and beams. The woman behind it greets me with the usual welcome, ‘Irrashai-imase.’\nI take a table at the counter facing a wall-shelf of neatly arranged cups ranging from tea porcelain down to pilsners. Finally, I settle on the roast I want, and the woman gets a man from the back to make it for me. He pours his beans and water with a meditative care, far removed from the settlers who would be huddling over a fire in cabins like this one two centuries ago across the Pacific.\nI ask him when he opened the shop, and he thinks a bit before saying, “About twelve years.”\nThe roasting machine by the window is the one they use to create the 12+ roasts in large glass jars. They are all clearly labelelled with their origin countries and flavours.\nI take a sip of mine and the layers of sour, savoury, and sweet flavours surface one by one. It’s a bit pricy, but definitely more complex than the solid 100 Yen coffees I’ve been getting at convenience stores. After lingering around waiting for my phone to charge and soaking in atmosphere of unhurried conversation, it’s time to get moving.\nAt some point, the road widens and the pavement looks maintained. Nakamura, recently merged into Shimanto City, has its own dialect instead of Tosa-ben. Perhaps it’s because Nakamura was once a castle town, known as the little Kyoto of Tosa (小京都中村), after the Kyoto aristocrat Norifusa Ichijo fled there during the Ōnin War between 1467-1477.\nI stop often, beaten by heat, and my feet, and my sweat. Eventually, I arrive at the onsen at the edge of town and buy a ticket. Once inside, I rotate nonstop between the jets (for the muscles), the mineral pool (relaxation), and the cold pools (because it’s hot!). I never used to understand why people would waste time soaking at all. Now, I never spend less than an hour in the pools.\nI also love how no-one takes a third look at me in onsens. My regrowing hair on my shaved head might have a few heads turned, but they quickly return to conversation after ‘confirming’ my gender. Ironically, Japan’s highly gendered norms works in my favour here because I’m not read based on the clothes I wear. Unlike my trans friends, I don’t mind which gender I’m read as so long as people don’t make a fuss or stare. It’s a small detail, but it governs my onsen experiences.\nAfter getting my money’s worth and even doing my laundry, I head across the street to the supermarket for lunch. It’s a feast with a bento box and even a yogurt dessert. Clean and fed, I feel like I can go forever if the sun never set.\nBut there’s no sun, which makes it feel late. I decide to skip Nakamura’s town centre and go along the Shimanto River heading south. Walking past the suburban houses in a small city is somehow depressing, like skirting civilisation and missing out on its comforts. Maybe the rain is getting to me. Maybe the clouds always hanging overhead have finally worn me down.\nThe magic of the onsen has already worn off.\nI give into lethargy and stop at another Lawson just before the bridge crossing the river. The covered bench and Wi-Fi combination keeps me for an hour, rechecking the route and weather, messaging friends. It was a bad decision. I know it when the rain begins again. Now I want to leave even less, but I know I have to.\nWithin minutes, the droplets come hurling down in earnest. As I cross the massive bridge, I’m drowned in the deluge. There’s nothing to do but persist until I find shelter on the other side. Finally, a new building with a veranda appears, and I scurry underneath. I remove my jacket and soaked runners, anchor my umbrella so it won’t be blown away by the wind and leave my backpack to drip against the wall.\nI give in. I settle down to nap until the rain stops, if it will. If it doesn’t, then this is where I’ll stay tonight. The Muslim phrase inshallah, God willing, takes on a new significance. I’ll leave it to the Heavens.\nA car drives up and an elderly man comes over. I stand up and apologise for effectively squatting at the entrance of the community office. He waves it off and says I can stay as long as I want. After he unlocks the door, he asks if I wouldn’t want to come in instead?\nI decline. I’m still hoping the rain will stop and I can continue. I’d rather camp outside than give up hope.\nAfter napping some and sitting some, the rain thins into a drizzle. I pack to continue on to my original target stop, a rest hut about 8 km away past a 2km tunnel.\nThe road is the same meandering one south. Leaving the last town with a train station, it feels like I’m sailing out into open ocean after getting roughed up along the coast. I’d have less trepidation if I had no experience, no references for things gone wrong. But I do, and it makes this dark afternoon road seem even more ominous. It makes me want to run into the udon shop at a junction and comfort myself with a bowl of warm noodles. There are even benches and huts close by. Shouldn’t I just stop here for tonight? Maybe I should wait for better weather.\nBut being wet spurs me on. I want to at least walk myself dry so that I can start dry tomorrow.\nThe valley narrows and I follow the road uphill, finishing another snack along the way. I’m counting on a restaurant beside the hut for dinner. I’ll just hang out there until they close. I’m going to have a feast tonight to reward myself. Seems I needed a lot of rewards today. Oh well.\nFinally, I enter the long tunnel cutting deeper into the hills. It’s almost the end. When I exit, the restaurant isn’t in sight. Instead, I see a telephone booth with a sign for henro lodging, a phone number, and 12 kilometers to the next town. The marketing strategy is spot on for a tired henro like me, except I don’t want to pay.\nWhen I finally arrive, I’m too tired to be disappointed. It’s a drive-through with a row of vending machines. Behind them are two restaurants either to be swallowed by rust or squashed by dilapidation. Neither are open. Dinner will not be served.\nI check the washrooms and rest hut, which is on the slope above the road. Two figures are sitting in the shadows. Henro? I wouldn’t mind company in the mountains. Then, I see the two piles towering over them. Those can’t fit in backpacks.\nI retreat to the toilets, which have clean, inviting benches in the sitting area. I can easily fit on one of these. I sit and consider my options.\nFeet. Calves. Shoulders. Back. Eyes. Stomach. Wet. Stiff. Aching. Strained. Sore. Will be hungry.\nFriendly(?) squatters.\nI see a poster on the wall. I think it says ‘There are many lodging options around here. Please use them.’\nThat’s it. I turn on my roaming and phone a ryokan that’s on my henro guide another 5 kilometers down at Shimonokae. I book a night without meals and tell the lady where I am.\n‘It’ll take you about 45 minutes,’ she says. ‘We’re behind the Lawson. Please be careful.’\nI immediately perk up at the Lawson. Dinner and internet. I thank her and put my wet runners back on.\nThe squatting couple wave to me as I walk past. I nod back with mixed feelings. Their horde unsettled me more than their homelessness.\nI ignore the soles of my feet, flattened and suffocated. My shoulders I can’t ignore and I drop my bag here and there. My limbs fall in line knowing that salvation is near. I can’t stop the pain, but my body works in unison to suppress it for as long as it takes for me get to Shimonokae.\nI arrive at the Lawson close to the predicted time soon after 6. However, I take my time to check messages again. Small treats like these mean so much. I buy onigiri and bananas and head over to the bridge to see if there are signs to a zenkonyado as my guide said, out of curiosity. I don’t see any and feel better about making the booking. The lady I spoke to sees me and runs to the door. ‘We were worried! Your shoes are wet aren’t they? Please go around the side, over there.’\nI do as she says and climb a flight of stairs to the side entrance. Her husband is there to greet me and teaches me to stuff my shoes with newspaper to dry faster. I can’t understand his accent, but he continues dispersing other tips.\nThen he leads me to the end of the hall, where I have a small entrance to put my wet bags down outside my room. After that, I head into the shower. When I peel off the clothes, I feel cold my skin underneath. I blast the shower and sit in the tub for a long time after that. Once clean and dry, I do my laundry in the machines, which most ryokans have. By the time I’m done these errands and eating, it’s time to pass out.\nReplaying the places I’d passed today evokes a series of ups and downs that already feel so distant. These places may only be kilometres apart but made me feel so different I may as well have crossed prefectures. Covering such short distances compared to modern transportation expands the distance we cover internally. We need to fill our days, and we have nothing to fill them with except ourselves. Internal conversations that normally unfold over entire years are covered in mere days. As someone who could not stop thinking, I’ve finally reached long stretches of contented silence.\nI hit the sack pleased that I’ve overshot my goal. Tomorrow, I will finally reach my destination.\nIt feels like the end is near. Kochi, you’ve been rough, but you’ve been good.\n"});index.add({'id':24,'href':'/book/docs/Diary-Entries/day-19/','title':"Day 19 - July 9",'section':"Diary Entries",'content':"=====\nShimonokae 下ノ加江 → Hirata Station (平田)\nTemples: 38 (Kongōfuku-ji 金剛福寺)\nWeather: Cloudy + Sunny\nTravel Method: Walking + Bus + Train\nDistance: 24.7 (+51.7) km\n=====\nI set my alarm for 5am and it’s barely twilight by the time I get out from the covers. Instantly, I regret laying out my dryish clothes last night; the humidity has tampered with them. Never mind. I pack and eat breakfast, finishing the rest of the cold barley tea from last night. I still have time so I slip outside to take photos of dawn before leaving.\nThe couple are waiting for me by the time I get to the entrance just after 6:00am.\nThe ojii-san has a bag of osettai onigiri prepared for me. They’re humongous, and I’m grateful for any food today. He tells me I should loosen my laces and remove them near the front to give my feet breathing room. It’s a good idea, but I want to get going, so I thank him and tell him I’ll do it later.\nThe goal today is to get to Cape Ashizuri early so that I can enjoy a celebratory onsen soak over the sea with the option to head back up to Nakamura via bus. This afternoon, I’ll finish my first, longest, milestone, from cape to cape.\nIt feels like ages since I’ve started. Kochi’s worked its way deep into me, gotten under my skin, been as rough as people warned, and showered me with generosity and lucky breaks. I’ve enjoyed the challenge, but I’m looking forward to the other side of Shikoku in the more densely populated Ehime and Kagawa Prefectures. I’m looking forward to civilisation.\nNot long after setting off, I see small henro with a conical sedge hat and hakui, the traditional white vest, covering athletic-wear. The gait looks oddly familiar. I tail at a distance, giving myself time to turn on a social mode. I’m not used to seeing henro walk.\nShe stops ahead at a bridge and starts taking photos. I come up, take a look, and take a few shots too. I turn to introduce myself.\nWhy, it’s Yumi-san! Why is she here? Where is her large backpack? I assumed that she was ahead of me, setting a pace comparable to the other female henro I met two days ago at the michi-no-eki.\nShe also stayed in Shimonokae last night, at a lodge with a special henro rate. She’s left her backpack there and will be walking down to Cape Ashizuri an back today. If only I’d met her last night! But better late than never.\n‘It’s over 40km round trip!’ I exclaim.\nWithout a backpack the 40km walk today will be manageable, is her cheerful reply. I don’t have the heart to tell her that it’s actually 24 kilometers one way, making her round trip closer to 50 kilometers.\nBut I’m glad I’ve met her. Time passes quickly with her around. Her English is great and it’s my chance to learn more about Kochi from a local.\nWe follow the road along the jagged coast, comparing our respective English and Japanese print, Android and iPhone maps. Before long we’re at the beach at Kaiyu. Yumi doesn’t have sandals, so we skip on walking through the sand. I wanted coffee, but skip on a cafe to try finding one in the small town. We get to the other end without another option. By then, we’re both tired, so we take a break and exchange snacks at a spot where kites circling in the sky.\nWe keep on the lookout for the henro stickers. They’re few and far between, so we have to ask for directions. Eventually we make it to Iburi Port, where there’s a large, covered rest area. Someone camping on one end. We choose another section and spread our snacks, peel off our socks, reapply sunscreen and hang around. With conversation, it doesn’t feel like a waste of time. Yumi chats with a lady on the other end and we learn that there’s no food to Cape Ashizuri. Maybe a restaurant in Kobotsu.\nI notice Yumi replacing a bandaid. She shrugs it off. She might look like a city-girl, but she’s taken the scrapes and injuries in stride. I dig up the surgical tape, which is a better option, and pass it to her.\nWe decide to take the beach route out of Iburi. It’s depressingly covered in trash. From there, we follow the hennro-no-michi into the forest with a muddy path to connect back to the vehicle road. With Yumi, it feels more like exploring than another inconvenient, muddy route.\nYumi’s wearing light cloth sneakers, which don’t look ideal. It’s rainy season and the slightly sunken paths are the last to dry. She says they’re extremely comfortable and dry fast. Really?! Really.\nWhen we reach Kubotsu we gulp our purchased drinks in front of the vending machine. The sun is back and it’s a race against time to reach vending machine check points before dehydration. Yumi takes a nap behind a warehouse and I go searching for food.\nThere’s only a sit down restaurant with lunch sets. The heat’s killed our appetite, and it’s early, so we’ll just ration our snacks. We use the complimentary henro washroom and reapply sunscreen again.\nI ask Yumi what the bronze-coloured lotion (1 of 3) she’s applying is. She says it’s sunscreen. Then she laughs, ‘I look horrible. But I don’t care! I don’t want my face to get dark.’\nWe both look horrible. We laugh over these little commonalities. The little things that were a burden when alone are the common experiences connecting us. I can finally share experiences with someone who’ll understand.\nYumi takes my plastic food bag and says, ‘I’ll carry this the rest of the way. It’s my osettai.’ Even we aruki henro, usually the receivers, give what we can. What we can is usually what someone else needs.\nNoon is fast approaching, and the sun is intense. We’ve both been walking 6 hours, but having company urges us onward. We see two henro with walking poles and huge backpacks, and they pass advice to Yumi before continuing on. She’s seen them before; they’re Koreans who speak fluent Japanese and she says they walk extremely fast.\nWe list other walking henro we’ve encountered. I’m beginning to feel the invisible community. It’s a thread tracing a circle around Shikoku.\nWalking henro are all respected. Nojuku henro earn admiration. Summer nojuku henro raise eyebrows. Walking in the middle of tsuyu, rainy season, and high summer means risking heat stroke and having fewer henro and support services around for help. But the henro you counter are more excited, concerned, and willing to share. I’d glad give up my sanity to experience summer henro solidarity.\nSoon after, we arrive at the legendary Tsuro zenkonyado that the guys mentioned. It’s a large shack with benches, a hot pot table, a room with a bed and futon, a toilet, and even a laundry machine (although power’s out now). It’s henro luxury. Its walls, ceilings, and pillars are plastered with neat rows of osamefuda.\nThis is evidence of the thousands, of nojuku henro whom have come before us. Amongst the white ones, there are many red, green, silver, gold, and even 2 brocade ones. This means nojuku henro whom have completed 5, 10, 20, 50, and over 100 rounds. It’s our own niche history.\nIn silent agreement, we sit down for lunch. We ask another henro walking past to join us. It turns out he’s the Japanese studying in Vancouver that Yumi was telling me about earlier. When we finish, we add our slips to the table too.\nIt feels good to be connected to everyone who has sheltered here, to feel the same gratitude they did when they arrived in rain or shine, night or day. It feels good to have a way to acknowledge the owner’s generosity. I want to build a henro hut one day.\nWhen we leave, I drop the conversation and pick up the pace. It’s past 1:00pm and our relaxed pace is costing us. I sense Yumi is tired. I’m tired too. My feet are swollen from the heat. But we need to arrive at 2:00pm, and I don’t mind if she thinks I’m mercurial. At our pace, she will take 8 hours to get back to Shimonokae at 10:00pm. If we arrive at 2:00pm and she returns in 6 hours, she’ll be walking in the dark. I should make the 3:38pm bus back up to Nakamura.\nAfter pushing, we arrive at Kongofuku-ji at 2:24pm. I take a picture for evidence.\nIt didn’t matter that there were crowds of tourists, coming for the Cape and temple. It almost didn’t matter that the temple seemed a bit gaudy. We made it. We take photos, wash our hands at the entrance, and drop our bags in the shade. Thank God. Thank Buddha. Thank anything.\nI want to sprawl on the ground with satisfaction. But, no matter what you’ve accomplished, there’s the next thing to do.\nNext, the prayers. We go by ourselves. I want to have this moment alone, and maybe she does too. I light my incense at the Main Hall, and again at the Daishi Hall where a group of white-vested bus pilgrim are gathered. This is for a friend who founded a company to ‘explore and protect the oceans’ and is tenaciously building that dream. He knows how it feels to sleep on rooftops and on the street, and is still a dreamer, an optimist, a believer in people.\nI think about his long and arduous moments and how they’ve never dampened his smile as I walk around the grounds, through the various shrines, gardens, statues, artificial ponds. Then, I get his nokyocho.\nQuiet despite the ‘crowds’ at Temple 38.\nAfter that, there’s nothing more to do. We go outside to the row of gift shops and restaurants looking for food. I ask Yumi she’d like anything, hoping to treat her, but she says no. Nothing appeals to me, either.\nI hand Yumi the surgical tape from earlier today. ‘O-settai.’ I say. I have another roll. She needs it more.\n‘Are you still going to the onsen?’ She asks. She’s been to the one I wanted to go to, which is up the hill with a view of the sea. ‘It’s just really big,’ is the only compliment she finds.\nIt’s dull clouds again, and at least 30 mins walk uphill. It doesn’t feel like a celebratory soak if I’m rushing to catch a bus. I don’t want to stay. I’ll take the bus.\nShe should get going. She didn’t want to bus, and I admire her resolve. I watch her retrace our steps from an hour ago. I asked her to message me after arriving, concerned about her walking at night. If I were her, the walk back would feel lonely. She’s doing the longer, harder half. I’m happy to know she has an o-settai dinner and a warm bath waiting. It’s well deserved.\nThe bus takes me, the only passenger, up the Cape in the other direction, giving me a full view of the town. The hotels and ryokans crowding the hills are unappealing. I look the other way at the ocean that I couldn’t see from the temple. The azure waves break against the cliffs, creating layers of white foam. At one bend, the driver stops and says, ‘Here’s a good spot for a photo.’\nIn shock, I ask, ‘Really?’\n‘Well, a minute or two will be okay.’\nI don’t need a second invite. I rush out and take a few shots. This is breathtaking, priceless – celebration enough.\nI thank him and sit back down, trying to take in the landscape through heavy eyelids. I nap up to Nakamura station, occasionally looking outside, noticing how the water on this side is a royal blue instead of black, and how the houses are layered into the hills.\nBy the time I arrive at Nakamura, it’s almost dark and raining again. I only passed here a day ago. By now I’m too tired to find the henro hut in the town centre. I’ll just nap in this new station until midnight, hop on the last train and sleep at the closest station to the next temple.\nI didn’t expect to end the first chapter of my henro pilgrimage without much fanfare. I thought I needed celebration. This is just another nojuku night, but I’m not disappointed. I finished. I finally had company with someone I admire and communicate with, someone to share the moment of arrival with. We often get what we wanted, just not the way we expected.\n"});index.add({'id':25,'href':'/book/docs/Diary-Entries/day-20/','title':"Day 20 - July 10",'section':"Diary Entries",'content':"=====\nHirata Station (平田) → Michi-no-Eki Mima 道の駅みま\nTemples: 39 (Enkō-ji 延光寺), 40 (Kanjizai-ji 観自在寺)\nWeather: Sunny with Clouds\nTravel Method: Walking + Train + Bus + Train\nDistance: 12 (+78.1) km\n=====\nTired of trying to sleep, I get up at 4:30am.\nI spent the past four hours lying on the hard plastic chairs – the ones that curve up into ridges – on the platform waiting room at Hirata station. I learned that the lights stay on for about an hour after the last train. The 3am and dawn were chilly. Outside it’s just a uniform darkness sprinkled with a handful of street lamps outlining angular contours.\nI walk down the block to the Lawson to cure a thorn of chill lodged in my chest. I need a warm coffee. Praise decent convenience store 100-Yen coffees. Praise their 24-hour service. Praise their Wi-Fi.\nInside, I pick up an onigiri to replenish my salt levels after sweating all day yesterday. I haven’t tired of onigiri even though I usually pick the same flavour. They’re affordable, compact, easy to eat, relatively healthy. My eating habits are pared down to calculations of overall water, salt, and carbohydrate intake. Light snacks can be sweets for quick sugar. Calorically effective snacks have oil, like chips. Both make you thirsty, so better to eat them when a vending machine is around. Despite trying to load up, I doubt I make my 2000 calorie target. Today’s starts with my breakfast onigiri and coffee on the bench outside the Lawson. It’s my first real meal since yesterday’s lunch onigiri. Last night I nibbled at a yuzu pound cake at the station, too exhausted to search for other options.\nAfter breakfast, I convince the shopkeeper to let me leave my bag in the corner while I walk to Temple 40. He frowns reluctantly as he says he can’t watch it for me. I try to communicate that it’s my own risk. Still, he feels responsible and wants me to come back before his shift ends at 7. I’m confident no-one will take a dirty bag with a collapsing sedge hat.\nI walk down the quiet street with my staff and henro essentials. I love the melancholy twilight before daybreak. I love dawn. The shades of black, blue, purple, magenta are so subtle in their sleepy shifting. It seems to flip back and forth, as if night and day are in negotiations about how today should be. It feels like the hour of trespassing. Every house I’m passing probably has someone sprawled over a futon without covers.\nTemple 40 is only 45 minutes walk, and I arrive before 6:00. It’s early enough to catch the morning chants and see a lit Main Hall, normally dark by 7am when the office opens.\nI sit on the wide wooden steps and stare back out at the stone courtyard and the trees behind. Only the thin wisp of incense sways upwards from the urn. It’s barely past 6:15am.\nMy grandmother, if she were still alive, would probably be up moving about in the kitchen. That’s what I imagine, since I’ve never stayed with her. I think she probably had time to sit and stare out into the garden before my uncles got up. The uncle she lived with seems like the type who would more likely go to sleep at dawn. I\u0026rsquo;ve probably said fewer than 100 words to him all these years, but I always loved his basement most, where the aroma of smoke rose from his black leather lounge chair and shaggy white floor rug.\nI move to a bench facing the wooden passageway connecting the Main Hall and a multi-story dorm building. Between us is a small, intentionally kept garden. Another henro comes and goes and we exchange quick greetings.\nI’ll wait. 6:45 will come. I’m hoping someone will be setting up in the office for me to knock and ask for a stamp early. Japanese timeliness (15 minutes early) would make this likely. Buddhist discipline of things done just so would mean not before 7:00am.\nI wonder if my grandmother would like this garden. She likes Japanese dainty sizes. The elegant, multi-course kaiseki dinner she had in Kyoto, with my parents and me when I hadn’t learned to sit, was probably her most reminisced meal. I smile imagining the face she’d make if she saw my dishevelled state.\nThe stamp office is still empty at 6:45. What’s a nokyocho worth? It’s a piece of paper with ink on it, having as much value as we give it. There’s no guarantee it’ll be of value to my uncle, but treating everyone the same is of value to me. There’s no guarantee the Lawson shopkeeper will remember my bag, but I should keep the promise anyway. Making decisions with imperfect information is what we do every day. It reminds me of a TED Talk by Ruth Chang on how to make hard choices.\nIn the end, I chose to get the stamp and make my 7:00 commitment and see the man behind the counter serving the morning rush. By the time I get my bag, he’s already disappeared.\nI walk back to Hirata station to catch the train and bus to the next temple. Having kept my promise to myself to walk to Cape Ashizuri, I’m now getting myself to Matsuyama, some 200 km away, by any means possible. There are too many mountain paths for my disintegrating shoe and sprained ankle.\nWaiting 20 minutes on the platform feels so significant. I managed to squeeze in time for everything with time to spare. The groggy students fanning out onto the single platform for both directions probably feel like the could have done with 15 minutes more sleep. As they chat amongst themselves, I watch the morning colours play out on the hills and shifting clouds.\nThe train whisks me some 10 kilometers down to the city of Sukumo. I wait at the bus stop, and about an hour later get off at the entrance of Temple 40, the first temple for Ehime Prefecture.\nEven though today was my earliest start, it feels late after all the waiting and sitting. It seems the rainy season is ending, and summer is in full swing. It’s hellishly hot after sitting in train and bus AC. My legs still haven’t walked enough to wake up. Transportation’s convenience now has a disorienting effect.\nI pack away the thoughts and walk down the block, light my incense, wish a friend who is starting her PhD well, and get her nokyocho. This office is right in the Main Hall in the corner. The lady who writes my nokyocho is eager to practice her English when she hears my accented Japanese. When the small talk runs out, I comment on the heat.\n‘Ah, summer has come,’ she says with certainty. ‘The cicadas are calling. They never stop.’\nOh yes, that’s the whirling cascade from the tree outside. I’d already tuned it out, since it’s a common occurrence in other East Asian countries. A typical summer day indeed. I excuse myself. She says, ‘Sayonara.’ It means good-bye with an implied finality, and therefore rarely used. To her, our paths will likely never cross again.\nI have time before the same bus comes again to take me up to Uwajima City. I’m tempted by the delicate cakes in the bakery at the corner. I wonder how many customers from neighbouring towns come to sustain this little shop. Surely this small town doesn’t have enough to clear the display every day. In the end, I just sit in the post office across the street from my bus stop for the AC and hidden outlet I find behind a display case. About 10 minutes before, I head back out to wait for the bus.\nI doze on the ride north, and get off a few stops before the stop for the onsen I want to visit. In this heat, the two kilometres takes much longer than I’d anticipated. None of my previous walks prepared me for this. In the end, with no onsen in sight, I shelter in an udon shop for lunch, air conditioning and an outlet. The shop a simple, white standalone building with a wide parking lot in front of it. Inside is spacious, with high rafters and beams, raised wooden seating areas, a bar counter and regular tables. There are TVs in the corners and fans ready for guests that come at other hours. I randomly order a vegetarian udon, and settle in to charge my phone. I haven’t walked much today, but I’m starving. I’m also loving the ice cold water they serve me.\nWhen I finish lunch, I continue up the road. If I don’t find the onsen soon, I’ll just get on the bus again.\nThe onsen is in a michi-no-eki about 300 metres off the main road. It has a grocery market selling the local produce farmers drop off every morning, small shops, a cultural centre, restaurant, hotel, and the hot spring spa. It even has a free outdoor foot bath. The onsen offerings could keep weary travellers entertained all day. I deposit my shoes at the entrance, check in, and end up staying for two hours in the pools and lounges. The sun is also hot enough to dry my clothes in half an hour, so I do some light laundry too so I feel more productive when napping.\nEvery onsen has a scale, but I keep forgetting to check my backpack’s weight. I finally find out it’s 10kg, but this is without food and after I sent two boxes of stuff away. The recommended weight for women is 4-6kg. Ooops. I guess it’s better I didn’t know. I’ve been wrapping my shirts around my unpadded shoulder straps successfully for a while now. It’s a good enough solution.\nI finally re-emerge onto the street rejuvenated to catch a bus up to Uwajima, Ehime’s first city. It has a castle and some local dishes, but I’m eager to camp close to the next temple tonight. From Uwajima, I take a train up to Mima Station. It’s only two stops, but a long ride through the hilly interior.\nWhen I finally get off, evening is approaching. It’s about time for dinner, and I hope there’s something at the Michi -no-Eki Mima. Surprisingly, everything is closed. That means no proper dinner, as I’m a bit lazy to walk back out to the convenience store. But, on the plus side this place is new, well-designed, with clean washrooms. It also has picnic benches hidden around the side with more privacy. I think about sleeping on top of the table tonight. After snacking, I notice the shop stall in the middle of the parking lot. The boards cover the inside, and its walled in with corrugated plastic. When you climb in and lie against the board wall, you’ll seem like a pile of things. This is the best bed yet!\nI move all my stuff over, ecstatic at the raised boards and three walls. Now all I need to do is wait for sunset. And it’s a brilliant one.\nIt’s been a lazy, but eventful day. It reminds me of our human limitations, and our boundless potential to innovate solutions. Transportation has brought me back to modernity. I’ve covered a week’s worth of walking in the past 24 hours since Cape Ashizuri. I’ve crossed from Kochi to Ehime Prefecture. The Dojo of Ascetic Training is over. I’m spending my first night in the Dojo of Enlightenment. I think Enlightenment also means letting go of dogma. You take what you can get. You do what you need to do. From here on, I’ll do whatever it takes to finish by August 1.\n"});index.add({'id':26,'href':'/book/docs/Diary-Entries/day-21/','title':"Day 21 - July 11",'section':"Diary Entries",'content':"=====\nMichi-no-Eki Mima 道の駅みま → Matsuyama City 松山市\nTemples: 41 (Ryūkōji 竜光寺), 42 (Butsumoku-ji 佛木寺), 43, Meiseki-ji 明石寺) 51 (Ishite-ji 石手寺)\nWeather: Sunny\nTravel Method: Walking + Train\nDistance: 23.8 (+75.3) km\n=====\nA fellow henro once told me, ‘When far from the temple, wake early; when close, rise later.’ Sleep is precious everywhere.\nStill, I rise at 5:30 today because I woke naturally and I want breakfast. The Lawson close by has seats, which means I get to enjoy a dignified meal, seated, with my food laid out on the counter.\nAs I pack, a photographer pokes around the michi-no-eki with a DSLR. It’s an ungodly hour for artists. I’m tempted to ask what he’s photographing. It could be anything with the massive lense he’s wielding. He takes an interest in me too, aims from a safe distance, and shoots. By the time I’m done my errands, I know he has records of me going to the toilet, cleaning up my stash on the storefront, sitting around, standing around. I wonder which photos will end up in the net, or perhaps a print. I hope none, but being the subject (object?) of interest is flattering.\nI leave an osamefuda tacked to the stall post, under another one that’s been left. Osamefuda are dropped in temples and given to people who offer henro o-settai. Marked with the name, address, and date essentials, they are the little pieces of us we leave behind. The only thing we can offer. They’re just pieces of paper that might not matter a shred to a shopkeeper making ends meet. They deserve one anyway.\nI wonder what the owner’s like. It’s a Tosa shop in Uwajima, which is historically part of Iyo (modern-day Ehime Prefecture). I wonder what brought a ‘rough’ Tosa person north, although Uwajima is historically the more wild and rugged side Ehime.\nI take one last look look at my sleeping spot, swept clean. As with most nights, the heat and chatter outside late at night woke me up. But it was such a snug corner with thin walls for privacy in an exposed parking lot. Sleeping humans are just unconscious masses of flesh and bone on a surface – so ignoble, so animal. The image of myself sprawled out on the boards at the Susaki Henro hut appears, a bare, exposed truth. The image is humbling, yet liberating.\nIs this early bird photographer a student, a journalist, an amateur? After I’ve gotten onto the road, the he stands at the exit and points down the road, the eye of the lense square at me. In the city, I’d have walked up to chat. As a henro, I move on.\nAt the Lawson, I pick up a feast for breakfast to spread on the counter. When done, I sip on the iced coffee while charging my phone behind me. I have lots of time before Temple 42 opens at 7am.\nAt 7:00, I do the quick half-hour walk through the fields. I’ve been thinking about high school friends, as I do every now and then. They’re my reference point for friendships since.\nThese old friends are my strongest memories of pleasant surprises, staple laughter, belonging, generosity, alienation, expectation, anger and disappointment. It’s hard avoid such complications when everyone’s seeing each other every day in high school. But even as we shared our school, friends, our thoughts, our interests, we so often kept our problems at home to ourselves. I had my ambivalences about them then, and new hesitations with friends now. I have so many friends to dedicate wishes to — where to begin?\nThe next temple was an hour away and has a more secluded air. This one has the most pristine incense alter to date, a swept plane without beginning or end. It is flanked with statues at the entrance, has prominent main gate, well-tended trees for shade, dignified halls that display great craftsmanship rather than size. The architectural finish should sufficiently meet my architect friend’s standards – or more accurately, her boyfriend’s.\nI hang around. I have time. This place has an outlet for me to charge my phone, too. The next temple is just over 10km away, maybe a 3 hour walk if I take my time? From there, I’ll take a train into Matsuyama to Temple 51’s tsuyado and call it a day.\nAlmost two hours later, I’m rushing down a forested hill. I’m still 8 kilometres out from the next town despite what I thought was a good pace. I need to make it to Temple 43 and then to the train station. I barely have two hours.\nOnce I’m out of the forest back on the road, the noon heat is relentless. I should be used to it by now, but this is much worse than Kochi. I should give up, there’s no way I’d make it unless I run. But I have a full backpack in this heat. I can only manage an alternating brisk walk-and-jog. I’m really pissed. Bad judgement, entirely avoidable – again. I could have left the temples earlier and walked faster. I had so much time. I need to make up lost time, even if I’m risking heat stroke. This is the first time it’s ever occurred to me, and I don’t have water. Nor do I stop to buy any at a vending machine I pass. It’s the first time I swear. Once I start, the stream of profanities carries me all the way into town. I curse at the heat, at a turn, at the next block, at myself, at daring to still feel pain in my feet. Feeling pain means not focusing enough. I feel like I’m falling apart.\nFinally, I accept I won’t make it. The anger and regret just vanish, puff. I just want to finish properly, at a diligent pace rather than just fizzle out onto the pavement. Eventually, I reach the shaded hill behind the town. At the parking lot, I charge past a group of driving henro up steadily mounting the steps. Carried on autopilot, I quickly finish my prayers.\nThen, I see the lineup at the stamp office, and smile. It was never meant to be. I’m happy I tried anyway, and happy I don’t have to agonise over every step racing to the train station. Instead, I wait my turn patiently to get my stamp and get an ice cream at the parking lot souvenir shop. Water, too, of course.\nHeat stroke crisis is averted. There’s air conditioning in the temple canteen and a plug behind me. What more can I ask for?\nWhen the shop is filled by a new group of bus henro, I decide it’s time to leave. I take a shortcut through the mountain paths and into town, where the streets are paved with uniform flagstones, the wooden traditional shops with polished wood and gleaming tiles. This town is a natural set for historical movies.\nAt the station, I discover that the next train is an express, and 2000 Yen instead of 600 Yen local (which is in two hours). Sigh, at least I can afford to buy the extra time. Money is good for covering mistakes. Soon, I’m sitting on the train dozing off to sleep. There are only so many hills you can watch race by at 100+ km per hour. An hour cuts at least three days of walking up to the mountains of Kuma Kogen and back down into Matsuyama. Since Cape Ashizuri 2 days ago, I’ve raced over almost two weeks of walking.\nI arrive in Matsuyama barely an hour later, at 3:30, and walk through the downtown area to Temple 51, Ishite-ji.\nI feel like a feral human entering civilisation. The cars, the people, the tram, the shops, the restaurants, the lights! The noise! It’s more exciting than when I stood in New York’s Time Square, Tokyo’s Shibuya Crossing, or London’s Trafalgar Square, Hong Kong’s Causeway Bay, you name it.\nIshite-ji is a temple of the city. It a 15 minute walk from the popular Dogo area, and has been kept well by its patrons. Its entrance is half hidden from the street, but sports a moat, statue, carefully selected trees, and embellished archway. After that it’s a covered arcade that points to bustling trade throughout the centuries, if they weren’t pedalling modern worship trinkets and souvenirs. Finally, you reach the temple gates, and enter the open courtyard. Ishite-ji is the site where Emon Saburo was reborn with a stone in his hand. The Matsuyama merchant, it is said, turned away a beggar at his door and lost his son days later. Realising it was Kobo Daishi, Emon Saburo circled Shikoku searching for him in vain for years. When he finally gave up and went counter-clockwise, Kobo Daishi appeared and asked what he wished for. By then, the converted merchant said he wanted to be reborn to help others. The temple is supposedly the site of this miracle and literally means stone-in-the-hand temple.\nThe temple gate, Main Hall, various sculptures, Daishi Hall, and historic bell tower are all national treasures over 700 years old. Even the more recent gigantic red lanterns and massive incense urn are sights. The Daishi Hall is covered in students’ prayer sheets asking for good grades. This temple still sits at the centre of local and tourist culture.\nI say my prayers for a local friend who would have enjoyed Matsuyama as a culinary, cultural, historical, and strolling getaway. After that, I pick up her nokyocho and register for the temple’s tsuyado. A few minutes later, an elderly man shows me another building across the street that they use as storage on the first floor, and a ceremony and prayer hall on the second floor. There are stacks of futon, blankets, and pillows in the corner. He shows me the narrow walkway between the towering boxes to the toilet on the ground level, then says ‘Jiyu ni‘, come and go as you please, before leaving.\nI hang my sweat-soaked clothes on the lines to dry. Then, I realise I left my staff at the temple in my hurry. It’s like forgetting my companion, Kobo Daishi, whom has been supporting me as a third leg every day. I go out to retrieve it and pick up dinner.\nOnce I’ve stopped, I’m usually loathe to venture out again. So dinner, I decide, will be whatever is cheap within a block of the temple. That means the sweets shop across the street that caught my eye earlier. I pick up a red bean manju, steamed bun, and a Dogo manju, made with the water from Dogo hot spring close by. In the shopping arcade, I see two remaining grilled green mochi, a sweet Ishite-ji is famous for, left at a closing stall. These used to be free for pilgrims, and now set us back 50 Yen a piece.\nI enjoy both desserts on the large wooden table I’ve flipped down back in my sleeping hall. Then, I clean up using the washroom corner sink, which only runs when I flush. There’s a lot of flushing before I’m done. It’s barely 8pm, but I’m calling it a day.\nI checked all the rooms earlier when I arrived. I saw another name registered at the temple list and was surprised to be the only guest. It’s paranoia, but I’d rather put my demons to rest. Paranoia can’t be reasoned with, but it can be put away.\nI put my staff beside, move the tables to block the other sliding doors and leave the far row of lights in the room on. This place is so comfortable, I’m determined to sleep well!\n"});index.add({'id':27,'href':'/book/docs/Diary-Entries/day-22/','title':"Day 22 - July 12",'section':"Diary Entries",'content':"=====\nMatsuyama City (松山市)\nTemples: 50 Hanta-ji (繁多寺), 49 Jōdo-ji (浄土寺), 48 Sairin-ji (西林寺), 47 Yasaka-ji (八坂寺), 46 Jōruri-ji (浄瑠璃寺)\nWeather: Sunny with Clouds\nTravel Method: Walking + Bus return to Matsuyama\n**Distance: 13.5 km **\n=====\nHoliday! Today, I’m going to Dogo Onsen, which was mentioned in Japan’s earliest collection of poetry, the Man’yōshū, and reportedly the inspiration behind Studio Ghibli’s Spirited Away. Even the semi-legendary Prince Shotoku, credited with sponsoring Japanese Buddhism and authoring its first text, once graced these waters. But, not before I do a bit of walking. It’ll be an easy breeze through 5 temples that are about 12 km apart. It’ll make the onsen soak even better.\nBreakfast is the manju made from Dogo’s onsen water. Mmmm. Satisfaction.\nI pack up because tonight, I’ll stay at Fujiya after walking backwards today from Temple 51 to Temple 46. Yesterday, I’d taken the train from I’d skipped from Temple 43 to 51 because it means I can stay in Matsuyama a few days while visiting the temples around. My three days in Kochi City taught me the benefits of staying put.\nFirst up is Temple 50, Hanta-ji. Like Ishite-ji, it strikes me with a metropolitan sophistication and polish. The pillars are smooth, the modern office building is city-sized, the tokyō more embellished, the trees purposely placed. I light incense for a photographer and travel writer friend who loves coffee shops and cultural sophistication.\nThe next temple is just down the hill is more compact and worn but Jōdo-ji also has significant artworks and historical relics to boast of. It has a statue carved by an esoteric artist, thought to be one of the first of its kind in an age where sculpture was a craft. Then a drizzle comes, so I wait while listening to a middle aged woman and young man having a deep life discussion.\nNext up, is Sairin-ji, which is striking in how new its walls and gardens, and sitting area is. But best of all, it has kids laughing outside the side entrance: it’s some sort of community day with games and food stalls. It makes me think of someone. I don’t know why, just trust my instincts.\nNext up, is… food. It’s just past 11:00 and already my third food stop of the morning. No worries about getting enough nutrition today. The major hardship will be resisting gobbling up everything in sight. Actually, what do I mean resist? I can gobble everything in sight.\nThe debate is over. I start with my udon craving. Outside Temple 48, I cross the street to the shop conveniently across the street. Cities are littered with conveniences.\nI take a seat at the bar and finally go all out with the seasonal udon on the chalkboard menu. Normally, a simple udon costs 300-400 Yen in these parts. The 790-Yen special comes as a full set and an inverted bowl of grated grated daikon and cucumber that I watched the kitchen just prepare. Throw in the deep fried age, onions, and burdock root and I’m in heaven. Even though I’m in one of Shikoku’s largest cities, I’ve been threading through quiet residential areas since the morning. Now, I’m hitting field-suburbia. The eight kilometres to Yasaka-ji would have been peanuts in Kochi, but now registers as many konbini-less fields away.\nJust as I’m thinking that, someone shouts, ‘Ohenro-San!’ A woman on a bike thrusts a bottle of milk tea at me. It looks like her afternoon tea run, but she waves it off and turns away towards the quiet houses.\nI continue along the fields. Suburbia is that space between rural one-way roads and ubiquitous city signs. With the maps not entirely complete, it’s an easy to take the wrong turn. I walk past two stone steles, one almost worn smooth beside another with precisely cut words and a pointing to Temple 48. I wonder how old the path underneath the smooth concrete is.\nI walk past a nice-looking daishido, another listed nojuku spot. More fields. More well-kept country houses. The residents of Mastusyama seem to fare better than their Kochi neighbours.\nI arrive at Yasaka-ji via the back door, one of the supposedly eight routes into the complex. I do my prayers and get the nokyocho. The stamp office has a basket of snacks marked as o-settai, perhaps the only detail I will remember in future years. The adorable kittens hiding in a shelter beside the doorway are the other detail. There’s a sign for their adoption. Their mom presides over the main entrance at the bridge.\nThe last temple is just on the other side of the hill. Jōruri-ji feels like it’s grown out of the jungle. It’s almost over-run with tropical broadleaves and dangling blossoms. It’s fun, hippie-like. My cell is dying, but I take a picture of the small Japanese maples underneath the towering canopy. It reminds me of an elementary friend who used to believe there was a giant tarantula in her overrun backyard – also jungle-looking. It also reminds me of more recent friends who arrange flowers and retreat to the hills to brew tea.\nWhen I go to the stamp office and the lady who writes the nokyocho asks if I have time to wait for refreshments. After a few minutes, she brings a tray of cold orange juice and a snack. She has a radiant tranquility about her, saying ‘Go-yukuri, yukuri.’ I try to exercise control over the food: not too fast as to be unappreciative, but not too slow to keep her waiting.\nI’m done for the day, so it feels late at 1:00pm. I exit out the main entrance with its natural archway of trees and wait in the shade for the bus. After two changes, I’m close to where I started this morning. Through the bus, I appreciate how ‘far’ I’ve walked in city terms as the farmland becomes residential, then commercial, then downtown city offices. So much is packed into 13 kilometres.\nDogo Onsen is conveniently located at the end of a tram line. Here, in the carefully preserved century-old architecture, I become part of the tourist crowd that bustle around the shopping arcade, the public foot bath, and the small side streets behind. Many are walking around in traditional yukata rented from the onsens.\nHenro itch satisfied, I put on my tourist hat. First thing is to try one of their local senpei from the arcade. While chewing on that, I try to figure out the three prices to Dogo Onsen. There’s the 300 Yen bathhouse, which is a steal for the historic experience. Then there are the private rooms.\nI’ve been looking forward to this all trip. Dogo Onsen is probably one of the only things even Japanese know about Shikoku. I pay and am led to the third floor, where I am given my own room. Every room has a balcony, and mine has a view of the party room and the hill where people walk up. When I’m done changing into the provided yukata, a traditional Japanese summer robe, an attendant brings me back to the second floor, where there is a general lounge and museum display. The attendant begins with all keigo, formal Japanese, to introduce the various parts of the onsen, but I can’t follow. Exasperated, he directs me to the bath the private bath for second and third floor floor guests. It’s a small, austere, stone bath with with about six seats to wash on wooden slab benches. It’s the first onsen that I’ve ever seen provide basic bar soap. After scrubbing yourself off, you enter the tiny square pool in the corner.\nAfter I’m done, I return to my room for tea and snack. I get a stick of tri-coloured Botchan dango, the famous food item here. My highlight is sitting and enjoying the atmosphere: the minimalist room, the flower arrangement in the corner, the breeze blowing through the open deck, the steam rising if you look around the odd corners of the building. I get out my notebook and write. That’s what Japan’s literary master Natsume Soseki did when he was teaching here.\nIt’s a two hour limit, and I’ve just changed when the attendant comes to gently remind me. I’m invited down the hall to Soseki’s favourite room overlooking the throng at the entrance below.\nTummy, feet, and soul satisfied, I head to the Fujiya Guest House. A street down from the onsen, the clamour disappears. I lose my direction in the uniform grid of houses. Eventually, a petite woman sees me and smiles, ‘Fujiya?’ She asks.\nYes.\nShe points down the street and gives me the directions. I’m glad my bare henro necessities – the hat and the staff – have served me well.\nI let myself into a house with peeling paint through the unlocked door. A girl with an expressionless face about my age shows me my room and puts my payment in her waist pouch. My bunk room is empty, and she tells me there’ll be no other guests, which means I basically get a private room. Plus, this place has a homey kitchen and dining area. Perfect. I drop my stuff off and head out to the nearby supermarket and do a grocery run.\nAbout an hour later, I’m back with two armloads of breakfast, cooking stock, veggies, snacks, drinks, and even mosquito incense.\nI cook and chill in the living room. Two other henro come in and pop open beers at the table, exchanging stories. This is one of those henro beacons, drawing us in from all directions, lest we feel lonely amid the city masses. Though strangers, we can feel grounded by the understanding nods of those who share similar experiences.\nBut the city has its merits. Tomorrow, I’m getting a much needed head-shave, meeting up with a Couchsurfing host, and picking up a new pair of runners. I crawl into bed early. I don’t need to sacrifice sleep to savour the moment. More to come tomorrow. I asked the obaa-san shopkeeper for permission to take these cute quotes and got an o-settai after hearing her henro stories!\n"});index.add({'id':28,'href':'/book/docs/Diary-Entries/day-23/','title':"Day 23 - July 13",'section':"Diary Entries",'content':"=====\nMatsuyama City (松山市)\nTemples: None\nWeather: Sunny with Clouds\nTravel Method: Walking + Car\nDistance: None\n=====\nGlorious sleep, oh glorious sleep. Real henro holiday. Henro-related things: zero. Today is errand day and lunch with a Couchsurfing host. I drift into the living room, savour the yogurt, cereal, and cut fruits. I step outside onto the covered veranda and my laundry baked dry. Clean. And it will stay clean for at least another day. Even the thought makes me giddy.\nI head out in search of a barber to shave my head. In this summer heat, even 2-inches has a noticeable difference. At 9am, nothing is open yet, and all the barbers happen to be closed. I return back to Fujiya and lounge at the veranda, staring into the parking lot thinking about what needs to be done on this day of rest. I need to get new shoes. I’ve been hanging on prayers that my runners last until Matsuyama. I mail 1kg of stuff to Tokushima. I should go to he hospital to get my sprained ankle checked. And explore the city. Matsuyama’s Dogo Onsen was known since the Asuka Period and reportedly visited by Prince Shotoku. It has a castle, and was featured in both the haiku-master Masaoka Shiki’s poems and literary giant Natsume Sōseki’s novel, Botchan.\n The Couchsurfing host, Noriko-san, has arrived. I messaged her weeks ago to ask about staying at her place when I arrive in Matsuayama, not knowing how far she was from the city itself. Unfortunately, it wasn’t a good time for her, but she suggested meeting me for lunch instead. We exchange greetings in the awkward way people who finally meet after many exchanges do. She hands me a pack of ice-tape telling me she bought them ages ago when her husband injured his arm and has no more use for them. I’m touched she thought to bring them. I’d only casually mentioned the sprained ankle to ask her for a hospital recommendation. I let her in to check out the place, which is an oddity in the neighbourhood. It’s like a small shack compared to the neighbourhood houses with garden pines peaking through the walls. We stand by the doorway, discussing what to do in the morning since it’s too early for lunch. Unsure of her plans, I tell her that I’ll need to do errands in the afternoon so cannot stay too late for lunch.\n‘Why don’t we just do all your errands now then?’ She suggests. She basically has fluent English and it’s much faster than me insisting on mangled Japanese.\nI’m relieved at the offer. I didn’t know where to find a good sports shoe store, let alone communicate my footwear needs.\nWe drive to the main shopping street in Matsuyama, which is an outdoor covered arcade, a typical feature in most Japanese cities. With her help as translator, I have a new pair of runners in half an hour that fits my wide foot-shape and orthotics. Noriko-san has convinced me to forget the hospital citing both lack of insurance and the lineup. So instead, we drive back to her place in the city of Usa.\nIt’s a modern, minimalist house in the middle of rice fields. She has to calm the dogs down before letting me in from the kitchen entrance. There are two little ones, and a big one that she says is scared of people and ferocious with strangers. He’s continues barking under the stairway most of the afternoon.\nNoriko-san.prepares udon for lunch while I play with the two little dogs and chat. I’m still in awe at her place, which she mentions casually is designed by a friend. It’s bright and has crisp lines with modern furnishings, with cupboards masked as walls and drawers seamlessly sliding under the kitchen bar-counter. It couldn’t be more different than her parents’ and grandparents’ houses traditional wooden houses close by.\nWe talk about concerts, the exchange that she did while in university, her field hockey team, and her favourite Korean pop band. Now, she’s an English teacher. One of the reasons she likes hosting is to meet people from abroad the way she used to in school. But, she laments, enough people come out to Shikoku. It’s isolated without direct flights to other countries – Korea and Shanghai being the only two exceptions.\nIn no time, lunch is served!\nLunch spills into coffee and dessert. I talk a bit about my previous work and describe the other temples along the Ohenro. I show her the photos of places I’ve camped out in, much to her horror. It’s only when she has to teach that we finally come to a stop.\nAs we’re heading out, she asks, ’Why don’t I drive you to Temple 44 and 45? The friend I was telling you about lives up in Kuma Kogen and I want to see the temples too.’\nIt takes all my self control not to scream a ‘YES!!!!’. I made a mistake in my time estimates and will be staying with an AirBnB host in Imabari tomorrow, which is 30+km away from Matsuyama and 100km away from Temple 44 and 45. Even taking a bus to the two temples in the mountains from Matsuyama is a headache. In short, her offer saves me twice over.\nWe agree on a time tomorrow and she drives me back to Matsuyama before going to her student’s house.\nAfter she drops me off, I wander around the city centre looking for a cafe to relax in. I can easily imagine spending a week here, watching the slant of the sun slowly shift from morning until evening from a cafe. My search for one takes me all through the old university area, into a traditional Japanese sweet shop, past Matsuyama hill with its mix of souvenir shops, established boutiques, and cheap homeware stores. The eclectic mix seems to have a settled into amicable relations, brought together by historically-influenced tourist lamps and red-brick pavement.\nI pick up a spare towel for 100 Yen. Such purchases need to be useful enough to justify their weight, and cheap enough to justify abuse.\nEven though I’ve hung up my henro life for today, my mind is still on the henro route tomorrow. To a walking henro, things are only as valuable as they are useful. Places only register if they offer shelter, food, necessities, wifi, or a camping spot. The rest is excess. The rest is what makes places special. The rest is what I go after today.\nThey include the little sweets from the dim shop lost somewhere in between second hand bookstores, grocery stores, and barbers in the university district. There’s the regional crafts shop, where I resist the urge to pick up a towel, small handkerchief, or tie. It’s a window shopping crisis. I make due by picking up some locally printed postcards. Consumer craving satiated, I sit contentedly on a bench in the shopping arcade to snack off my purchases.\nAfter that, I go to the supermarket for another grocery shopping spree and indulge in making dinner in Fujiya’s kitchen.\nThe girl who is minding Fujiya for free room and board is a funny character. She’s very quiet and sits on the porch all day, staring at the parking lot. In the evenings, she lights mosquito incense and continues.\nFor dinner, she picks up whatever is in the box in the kitchen corner and makes a one-dish meal with it. I tried to get her story when I first arrived, but she answered in single sentences. The gist is that she is travelling around Japan and basically stopping where ever she can find a free place to stay in exchange for some light work. She arrived only a few days ago, but she doesn’t seem too interested in going out. Perhaps she’s pondering the meaning of life, like the exiled wandering poets of old. Or perhaps nothing at all, like a puff of smoke.\nI retreat to my room, light my mosquito incense underneath my spread out tent tarp so that it can infuse the smell. It’s a funny contraption, an amusing last thought before falling asleep. It’s been a good break.\n"});index.add({'id':29,'href':'/book/docs/Diary-Entries/day-24/','title':"Day 24 - July 14",'section':"Diary Entries",'content':"=====\nMatsuyama City (松山市) → Kuma Kogen (久万高原) → Iyowake (伊予和気) Temples: 44 Daihō-ji (大宝寺), 45 Iwaya-ji (岩屋寺)\nWeather: Sunny\nTravel Method: Car + Light Walking\nDistance: (+42.6km)\n=====\nToday is a late day because Noriko-san, the Couchsurfing friend I’d met yesterday, is driving me up to Temples 44 and 45. Even though I was looking forward to a mountain trail between the two temples, a car is a much more realistic solution.\nI wake up late-ish, have breakfast, and repack all the things I’ve spread out over three beds in the empty dorm room. The smell of mosquito incense is reassuringly thick, which means my tent will probably keep the mosquitos away tonight. I had started using these coils after the concerned grandma and grandpa neighbours woke me up to give me the mosquito incense at the Susaki hero hut back in Kochi. I’d kept it inside my tent that night and for the next few the mosquitos that are the bane of this month’s existence were kept at bay.\nI put on the new runners that Noriko helped me buy yesterday, in all their neon shining glory. My old Mizzens had hung on for weeks with the help of repeated super-glue applications, but now there is no black sole grip left to glue. They’ve stuck by me through Europe, Asia, and North American, surviving wind, rain, snow, and stroke-inducing heat. They have earned retirement. I can’t afford to carry them, so I put them in with the box of things I’m mailing off without a clue about when I open it again in the city. I take photos for memory’s sake: shoestring whack.\nI catch the train from Matsuyama station after 9am to meet Noriko at a train station closer to her house. She had a bento for her husband before joining me.\nNoriko is decked out in full athletic gear, with the long leggings that stop muscles from spasming. I think it’s even more valued in East Asia because it prevents tanning. She also has a bag of water, snacks, and lots of mosquito spray. It seems she hates them as much as I do.\nFirst, she drives me to the nearby post office to mail 1kg off to a farm in Tokushima, where I’ll return when I finish this walk. A part of me feels guilty for never having asked before mailing, but I’ve given myself over to assuming that people don’t mind some things.\nThen, we sail up the winding mountain paths that reveal a vista of the mountain range that stretches through the heart of Shikoku. It’s only 30 kilometres away – about a day’s walk, and barely an hour’s ride. Noriko is game to try the henro-no-michi rather than drive directly onto the temple grounds so we walk about 15 minutes up. We arrive at the Front Gate guarded by the imposing Niō of Temple 44 at 10:50am. This gate is famous for its O-waraji, the humongous straw slippers meant to ward off evil spirits. Driving henro miss them on the paved road. These straw slippers are remade every 100 years, hanging under the dark wooden roof, between the guardian Niō or Kongōrikishi half hidden in the shade. Small pedestrians have the privilege of feeling awe.\nOnce at the Main Hall, we light incense and toss coins into the box. Even though Noriko has memories of visiting temples as many Japanese children will have done, she is not confident about the exact procedure. So instead, I pass on what I’ve learned about the rituals and chanting that we watch beside us – things that I’ve come to take for granted. The Ohenro rituals are more niche than I thought, or perhaps it’s one of those school experiences don’t feel relevant to many kids anymore.\nEven though this incense lighting feels familiar to me because some Chinese do it as well, there are subtle details like a triple bow in the Chinese custom. Details that seem small, only that I imagine they are significant to both Chinese and Japanese, especially in this space that has a particular reverence to rituals. I ask Noriko if it’s Japanese custom to light incense and bow once, almost as a finishing touch. She confirms this.\nWhen we get to the stamp office, I ask for a small nokyocho stamp rather than providing the usual book to write in. The elderly lady rummages the shelves and pulls out the old medicine cabinets, mumbling that they probably don’t have sheets. Eventually, she finds one and writes it for me. It’s wobbly, but one of the things I like about nokyochos is that each is unique, revealing a bit of the person who wrote it. A steady stroke, a flashy flourish, a messy scribble, a rushed trail all belie character.\nOnce outside, I want to use the washroom, so I ask if Noriko needs to go. ‘Is it clean?’ she asks doubtfully. Hard to say; my standards aren’t hers. She pokes her head in and exclaims, “It’s clean!” I smile. It’s a simple squat toilet, but has clearly been mopped and wiped daily. Toilets, I think, also reveal something about the places that keep them. Every time, I wonder if clean toilets reflect temple discipline or a rural Japanese standard. How little I know about the minds of the people who live here.\nAfter we’re done, it’s a quick drive through the mountains to Temple 45. Part of me misses following the natural mountain routes where the paths are drawn thinly by feet that tread lightly. The other part of me is just grateful for a ride and a chance to enjoy temples with company rather than always focusing on next-stop logistics.\nTemple 45 is arguably the most remote temple. From the parking lot, even driving henro must walk at least one kilometre. As we climb the stone steps, a stream of white-clad elderly bus henro are wobbling down. This place is an unavoidable nansho, trial place. Noriko-san couldn’t have chosen a better temple to dive into the deep end.\nWhen we’re almost at the top we pass a big tall, Caucasian, nojuku henro listening to an elderly Japanese man. I can tell from his enormous backpack and dangling mosquito incense. What on earth brought him across the world at a time like this? I want to ask him, but since I’m not alone, I keep my curiosity to myself. Instead, I point him out to Noriko so she has another nojuku henro reference. Iwaya-ji is probably the most distinct temple I’ve visited so far. Carved into the massive rock face, the buildings are low, cramped, and jagged to accommodate the rock. Mountains are solitary by nature, but what inspired anyone into a wilderness so deep even by modern standards? The dark, barren cliff looks god-forsaken. Only… it’s not. It is precisely the barreness that makes me feel a tug, a faint echo that must have led the female recluse Hokke-sennin here, and later Kukai here to received the grounds from her. This is the origin for this mountain temple.\nA new building is further out, in a bright clearing with a view of the neighbouring hills. It has just been completed, a feat of modern engineering for a place with no roads and barely any surface to put machines on.\nWe move on to the Halls. Again, I give Noriko-san incense to pray while I climb up a gigantic ladder up to a crevice in the rock. It is strewn with coins, left for good-luck beside the Jizo statue.\nNoriko’s afraid of heights, but curiosity gets the best of her. After a few minutes, she can see for herself the gentle waves of forested hills.\nWhen we head down to the stamp office, Noriko reads a sign in front of another cave. It is another Jizo for women who have had miscarriages. She says it’s meant for her and goes in to have a look. It’s an uncanny coincidence. I hang around the entrance to give her privacy. She returns and says there’s another tunnel inside. Oh? Then I’m interested. It’s a dark, damp tunnel, lined with planks up a slope. Then, it’s just rock worn smooth. In parts, it’s pitch black save for a candle at the far end. Before long, we’re in front of another statue also surrounded by coins and wishes. It feels eerie. The surrounding darkness and the dampness fill the place with … I don’t know. Hope? Sadness? It’s heavy, but not frightening. It’s too big to be contained in words.\nWhen we get back out, I get a nokyocho and we head back the way we came.\nAfter walking back to the car, Noriko drives into Kuma Kogen for lunch. She wants to treat me to a famous soba place in town. Since it’s closed, she phones her friend, who suggests an udon place. It’s in an unassuming barn-like building with a sign saying Kama-age udon (釜揚げうどん). We go in, seat ourselves, and consider the only three options on the menu. Summer is zaru-udon, cold udon, season, but we go with what the locals trickling in continue to order, the Kama-age style served with a sauce in a clay urn.\nWhen it arrives, we pour the special broth into our dipping bowl and self-serve our age (deep fried dough bits), spring onions, and ginger. We break into sweat from the effort of eating a hot food, with ginger(!), but it’s worth every bite. Our massive medium was a mere 400 Yen.\nNext — Noriko’s friend’s place for a quick visit. She’s just picked up her younger daughter from school, and we chat over coffee and cake. Her friend’s husband is a policeman, so they have to move every few years. It must be hard on her kids, who hang around politely. The little one tries hard to ‘behave’ for the adults, but can’t help occasional outbursts and sharing. It’s so cozy to just pay a random visit and have coffee catch-up at home, an increasingly rare occurrence in big cities. All too soon, it’s time for Noriko to go teach, so we head out.\nWe only make it down the block when Noriko receives a call because I forgot my bandana, and within minutes her friend drops it off for us. Then, we’re off, back to the Matsuyama, back to our daily routines – Noriko teaching, me obsessing about the next place to sleep. I struggle to stay awake despite the sunbeams pouring through the hills that unfold down into the plains.\nWhen Noriko drops me off, I leave her the nokyocho from Iwaya-ji. A good memory of a day her curiosity conquered her fear, one of many fears she’s conquered, and probably not her last. As a poor nojuku henro, it’s all I can give to repay her kindness.\nI’m too late to go to Temple 52, but too early to sleep. I hang out at Matsuyama station and do some work using the station Wi-Fi. For two hours, I put down my pilgrim’s hat for the remote work one.\nWhen I get off the train at a stop closer to Temple 52 and 53, I discover it’s suburbia — stretches of nothing much. A few days in Matsuyama and I’ve forgotten this basic fact. I’m a bit late for sleep-spot hunting. Night descends quickly, and the clouds of mosquitos thicken. I’d forgotten this basic reality too – the illuminated cities are night-immune.\nThe Taishogun Shrine, which was listed on my nojuku guide, is against a hill, raised, and secluded from the street below. I don’t like sleeping in complete darkness, or directly under lamplight, so I retrace my steps.\nI stop in a school and use the washroom. I’m tempted to hide somewhere until they locked up. In the end, I give in to propriety and ask. It’s a flat no, despite my feet dragging. They phone a nearby ryokan, but I don’t want to pay for lodgings, again. Eventually, the woman at the back, the most adamant ‘no’, asks if I’ve eaten dinner. Then, she deposits a bag of cherry tomatoes. What am I going to do with that many?! But I can’t refuse and thank them.\nIn the end, I sleep at a nearby park on a bench until 11pm, when the park lights turn off. Then, I pack up again and zombie-walk to a nearby konbini. It’s just one of those string-of-bad-choices days. It’d have been easier to sleep at the unattended train station I got off at.\nA bunch of guys finishing drinks ask me to join them. No thanks; I’m awake on adrenaline, but not enough to socialise. They see me again when I arrive at the Family Mart. The last one out hands me a 1000 yen and says simply, ‘Good luck.’ Very anime, but also very touching.\nI stand reading magazines for two hours while charging my phone underneath the racks. Time passes by the minute. Eventually, I walk back out to sleep at the back of the parking lot. I lay my tarp out over the concrete and put my sedge hat over my face. Swarms of gnats surround the Family Mart glass and street light above. "});index.add({'id':30,'href':'/book/docs/Diary-Entries/day-25/','title':"Day 25 - July 15",'section':"Diary Entries",'content':"=====\nIyo-wake (伊予和気) → Imabari City (今治市)\nTemples: 52 Taisan-ji (太山寺), 53 Enmyō-ji (圓明寺), 54 Enmei-ji (延命寺), 55 Nankōbō (南光坊), 56 Taisan-ji (泰山寺) Weather: Sunny\nTravel Method: Walking + Train + Walking\nDistance: 23.6 (+33) km\n=====\nAt 5:30, as a yellow glow appears on the horizon, I get up for the last time. Unable to find a suitable sleepingg spot, I ended up at a Family Mart close to Temple 53. I spent the remainder of the night flipping magazines indoors and napping outside with the mosquitos. Even though it’s not open yet, I go to Temple 53 to do my prayers. I want to make the best use of the cooler morning. I like walking through the early morning streets, something working life doesn’t afford.\nAfter lighting the incense, I look for a statue of Mary disguised as Kanon. In a time when Christianity was outlawed, this was one of the few places that Christians could worship in secret. Christianity’s presence is one of the sub-narratives of Japan’s history and I dedicate this temple to a pastor.\nAs I finish, a monk comes in, rings the temple bell, filling the empty courtyard with a resounding ‘ommmmmm’. It is part of the ritual to ring the bells where possible, which creates a mesmerising full-hollow sound. In these temples, no matter who you are, you are entitled to announce your arrival, to declare yourself through this sound echoing the origin, end, and eternity. After watching the monk enter the Main Hall, light the shrine, and begin his chants, I head out to Temple 52. It’s a straight walk through countryside, past a historical town, and up a shaded hill. At the end, there’s a waterfall and shrine to Kanon in a dark corner under the stairs leading to the gate. At the top is an open courtyard, still empty.\nI light my incense to a night-owl friend who seems quite proud of pulling all-nighters before deadlines. I light my incense at the Daishi Hall for someone I’ve not seen in almost a decade and probably doesn’t remember me. The things that made us click came bundled with what made us clash. Even if the drift was inevitable, I often think about how to tell her I learned a lot. I still haven’t found a way to say it.\nThere are so many people like her, people that have difficulty forgiving for precisely the lesson I’m grateful for. Do I only dedicate to people who matter now? How do I honour those who helped me get here?\nAfter all the considering, the dedication itself was rather straight forward. Use the lighter; angle the incense; bow three times; place the sticks. It takes 30 seconds. Having crossed the bridge, I can look back to see the steps that were so hard to feel through before: to forgive, to make an effort, to wish someone well, a wish that they will never know about, and will never thank you for. I think the remainder of this pilgrimage is about making peace. I can no longer avoid the people who drift into my thoughts and linger. Rather, I can no longer avoid the judgements, which were of my making. Nor can I deny my desire to wish them well. I might not have the chance to ever thank them in person, but it could be that I need to say it more than they need to hear it.\nI finish right when the stamp office opens, pick up the nokyocho and head back to the other temple that’s also opened by now.\nThen, it’s a long walk through the urban sprawl of Shikoku’s western coast. This side of the island has an unbroken strip of townships and factories, linked by a steady flow of cars. A lot of concrete.\nIt’s so early, but the sun is already horrendous. I stop a Lawson in town to get breakfast. I eat it in a park with a new rest hut. I should’ve just walked here last night instead of prowling around the same few streets. I could’ve at least slept. It wasn’t meant to be. Today, I’ll walk as far as I can, then take the train to Imabari. Now, I’m right beside the sea, blue and tranquil, so I can see several feet down. The sky is pristine blue, but a still sea feels eerie. Then I realise that my reference has become Kochi’s thrashing waves facing the open Pacific.\nI go through more townships. I walk past a hotel with washed out walls, an empty entrance, a massive lobby of tacky glass. It’s seen better days.\nEventually, I see an elderly lady walking down the street and cover her with my umbrella. She accepts the gesture and we chat since she’s on the way for me. Her actions are delicate, too composed for these parts. When I ask, she reveals she’s from Kansai.\nA man stops his car to give me candy o-settai and asks if we’re walking together. She quickly corrects him. Flustered, I don’t give him an osamefuda buried in my bag and she chides me after he leaves. After that, she tells me to put the sweets away. An endearing grandma she is.\nWhen she enters her clinic, I double back to the train station. The heat has beaten past my umbrella and sedge hat. I’m taking the train from to Onishi and walk the remaining 4 kilometers to Enmei-ji.\nThe train ride is way too short, not a long enough nap. Already, I’ve wiped 20 kilometres of walking.\nI alight onto the platform. It’s insanely hot. Ungodly. Hot. The heat roasts the the town into a ghostly submission. I stop at a Co-op supermarket for lunch, finish it quickly on a shaded bench outside. Another henro drops his bags down. He basically has three: a massive main one on a frame, two dangling behind, and reflective shields draped over everything. He takes a while to get the contraption on and off. Two umbrellas are tied to the sides. I’ve read about the walking henro who wander Shikoku, round and round, never leaving the henro-no-michi. He must be one of them?\nAfter he’s done shopping, he storms off. Soon after, I follow his radiant beacon despite it being midday. The cars become more numerous, the landscape more concrete, more yellow, more faded. There are no mountains, no sea.\nI get lost going to Enmei-ji. It feels like I’ll die of heat stroke among these quaint homes at ends on a hill. Eventually, an obaa-san points me in the right direction.\nThe Main Hall is behind scaffolding, being restored, so I make due with the Daishi Hall. The wooden statues behind the sheets are several stories high. I take a break at the stamp office with its comfy platform. I’m charging my overheated, battery-drained phone. I take off my shoes and let my feet dry off from the sweat. I like it here. The people are nice.\n Later, it’s more concrete, heat-warped highway. Then, a turn into quiet fields, but no less hot. That’s where I find Temple 56, the temple with the furomatsu, the undying pine, that Kukai planted. Even the temple dirt is sun-bleached, cake-yellow. But the office buildings are open, spacious, elegant. I make my prayers and poke around. This temple, like many in Ehime Prefecture, has a lake with a mini-temple in the middle, a mysterious aesthetic. The legendary pine is surprisingly squat, but radiates a tenacious green. Finally, onto my AirBnB place, recommended by a Kyoto farmer I’d helped in June. I will drop off my bags there en route to Temple 55 on the other side of town. After crossing the highway and getting into Imabari town proper, the residential streets are better. I find the AirBnB house, ring, knock, wait. Finally, I let myself in the unlocked door. An elderly man shuffles down the hallway and greets me with single English words. My room. Guest room. He doesn’t smile. Kitchen. He gets me to sit in the guest room and disappears, returning with refreshments, and then again with a sheet of paper. It single lines reading:\n‘I am Tsuneto. I am ## years old.\n‘My wife is Akiko. She is ## years old.’\nHis hearing be poor, so we need to speak more loudly. His English isn’t very good. His son must have typed it up for him.\nThen, he hands me a sheet for me to fill out my information, from my name and age to my food allergies. It’s almost like a clinic form. He is a doctor after all.\nWhen done, I explain to him in Japanese that I need to go to Temple 55. Can I leave my stuff?\nHe relaxes a little and responds back in Japanese. Yes, I can leave my stuff.\nI walk back out, feeling much lighter. There’s an onsen in the town centre. Awesome! Train station is close, excellent! Timely, as I need the washroom suddenly. Indigestion.\nA few minutes later, feeling normal again, I walk the remaining few blocks to Temple 55. And I’m glad I made it. It’s a lovely temple in an open square courtyard. All the buildings are facing each other – as though in pairs. The late afternoon sun has softened.\nI’m the second last person to get a nokyocho. I get another charm for the couple I dedicated this temple to so that they may each have something. The gentleman who writes for me has the best calligraphic hand I’ve seen so far.\nWhen I compliment him, he tells me stories of all his visitors. He’s eager to practice his English with me. He brings out his photo book, and shows me other Canadians. Then, he shows the latest visitors on his digicam. Eventually, he writes a few more pieces of calligraphy for me. Finally, when I notice that it’s 5:00 and don’t want to keep him, he rummages his drawers mumbling, ‘I may still have them.’\nThis gentleman wanted me to have a brocade osamefuda that another henro left a few days ago. He hands me the last one, delighted someone appreciates it. Silver (20+ trips) and Gold (50+ trips) osamefuda are already rare, and I’ve heard people fish them out of the temple boxes for good luck. A brocade osamefuda, made of embroidered silk or cotton only someone who’s done over 100 trips uses, is about one of the most treasured things between henro. I marvelled at them back in the Tsuro Zenkonyado, and now I’m just days behind someone giving these away.\nI’m back at the AirBnB house and meet Akiko. She serves me a light refreshment, and says I’d probably want a shower. Yes, I’m dying for one. When I’m done scrubbing the grime away, I flip through the books in the guest room, including the Lonely Planet guide for Japan. Their house is a walking museum. Every room has momentos from travels, paintings, and furniture preserved through the decades. Eventually, Tsuneto comes to get me: dinner time!\nDinner? Dinner is included? I was happy to get a roof over my head for about 1000 Yen.\nAs we eat dinner, Akiko comments that the typhoon is coming tomorrow. It’ll be landing tomorrow night. I’ve seen it in the weather reports too, and it’s weighed on me all afternoon. I’ve only booked this place one night, and they’ve mentioned they have other guests tomorrow. Akiko looks at me, ‘What are you going to do?’\nI shrug. I’m not sure. But eventually, I pluck up the courage to ask. ‘Is it possible if I stay another night?’\n‘Mochiron. Kamawanai.’ Of course. We don’t mind.\nWhat about the guests tomorrow? Where will they stay?\nUpstairs. There’s a spare room.\nI have a shelter from the storm. It could be as simple as that. I’m struck by the ease. I run through all the things that led me to this moment. It began because I wanted to travel cheaply in Japan. Had I not volunteered on the one specific farm in northern Kyoto, I would not have been recommended to these AirBnB hosts. Coincidence — or a thread of fate I’d like to believe. I’ve come to believe that the people we are meant to meet, we encounter not only once, but twice.\n"});index.add({'id':31,'href':'/book/docs/Diary-Entries/day-26/','title':"Day 26 - July 16",'section':"Diary Entries",'content':"=====\nImabari City (今治市)\nTemples: 57 Eifuku-ji (栄福寺), 58 Senyū-ji (仙遊寺), 59 Iyo Kokubun-ji (伊予国分寺)\nWeather: Rain + Typhoon\nTravel Method: Walking + Train return to Imabari\nDistance: 16.8 km =====\nTyphoon day! It’s forecasted to make landfall tonight, so I still have the morning to visit the temples clustered around Imabari. My hosts, having walked the Ohenro themselves, urge me to get up earlier.\nI crawl out of bed at 6:30am for breakfast as I’d promised Akiko. She’s humming away, asking if I want coffee, and tells me to eat first. She gets a warmed up dinner roll and a tray of condiments. Orange juice too. Who makes this sort of stuff?! They should just open up Minshuku Tokunaga.\n“That’s all we have, ne. 365-days a year. Because Tsuneto likes bread.” Akiko’s voice is apologetic, but also quite content with the breakfast she’s perfected over the years. Instead of worrying about a soaked bag and a night out in the storm, I’m coming back tonight. It makes me wonder if I’m going to use up my lifetime of good luck in this pilgrimage. I head out by 7am in the light drizzle. But by the time I’ve crossed the interstate highway, it begins to pour. The wind sweeps the sheets of rain horizontal. After a few attempts to persist a few feet I take shelter. No wonder people hole-up during typhoons. This is only the auxiliary force too. Who am I to fight with nature?\nBut I resume again and follow the vehicle road up to Temple 57 rather than take the muddy path that wraps around the hill. Unsurprisingly, the temple is empty. I lay out my soaked belongings, take off my shoes, peel off my socks and try to warm my feet. I have all morning to wait. Just the morning, that is.\nAnother henro shows up. Then, an elderly henro couple. We strike up conversation, curious as to why the other is out on a day like this. They leave. The ojii-san is walking to the next temple and bids me farewell. I light my incense and get the nokyocho. The young man at the office puts down his baby daughter to write it, apologising when she wails at his neglect. We chat a bit and his wife comes in to keep him company. I guess a job like this is quite fulfilling if you have a family and a calling. I can’t help but think of a hiring tag line: Family-Friendly Buddhist Temple Hiring Staff.\nIn many places, Buddhist monks are to abstain from sexual intercourse, but certain schools of Japanese Buddhism accommodate marriages for monks and nuns. This idea is said to be introduced by Saichō, the founder of the Tendai school, and exemplified by Shinran, founder of the Jōdo Shinshū (True Pure Land School). In the Meiji Restoration, the government passed the Nikujiku Saitai Law was passed allowing monks or priests of any Buddhist sect to seek wives.\nThe walk to Temple 58 takes me through three small winding hills. I catch up to the ojii-san who’s stopped for a quick breath. It seemed like a gentle incline on a paved road, but it becomes apparent he’s really winded. I decide to hang around and keep him company, since we’re basically at the gate.\nHe urges me several times to go ahead, aware that daylight is most important to all walking henro. If I wanted to go fast, I would go alone. But I’ve been going alone for a while now. Today, I’d rather go far, together. It takes a long time for us to ascend the stairs past the gate into the mists shrouding the Temple of the Faeries. He heaves by a small shrine to the water spirits. It gives me time to look around. Alone, I’d have just charged up the stairs, maybe never even noticing the bamboo forest. Eventually, the shadow of a Shinto torii gate materialises. I notice the sheltering emerald leaves with shining droplets. The mist shuffles off to reveal the temple buildings.\nThe ojii-san and I do our rounds separately. The stamp office is on the right of the Main Hall, and this time the mother of a quiet baby lying on the floor writes my nokyocho. Temple 58 not only has a tsuyado, but a bath and onsen. If I didn’t have a place to stay, I’d have stopped here tonight rather than risk going further. Thanks to my hosts, and to this ojii-san I can go to two more temples today.\nNakamura-san is walking the Ohenro between his business trips in Japan and the greater South-east Asian areas. His wife drives off to wait for him at the next temple, taking care of all the logistics. As we go down the hill, I ask him about his clean energy company and its patented technology. After doing his time as a salary-man, he teamed up with an old friend who was sitting on the patent. He seems reluctant to discuss the topic, skeptical that I’d understand with my basic Japanese. Instead he asks me about my work, which was basically investing in companies like his at an earlier stage. We suddenly have common terms like ‘incubator’, ‘accelerator’, ‘startup’, ‘angel investor’. That’s when his voice changes. When he continues about his company, the sentence where his pride shines through is, ‘We bring electrification to rural areas in poor countries. We help people get electricity, without harming the environment.’\nI ask him why he started the Ohenro. He says he likes walking. Then, he sighs in a resigned-contented way, ‘Saa…honto ni musukashii…‘ Man, it’s difficult. He’s referring to the wisdom in the texts. It’s difficult to have a Buddhist heart. But he nonetheless chants at the temples, following the scripture book at his own pace. There is Buddhism as a philosophy and Buddhism as a religion. Most people know the religion, which has three main branches and a multitude of sects. The Shikoku Pilgrimage’s Shingon Sect is one of the only Vajrayana – Esoteric – Buddhism lineages in East Asia. This school of Buddhism focuses on the rituals and meditative practices that lead to enlightenment. Enlightenment is not a distant, reality after many lives, but a possibility within this lifetime, based on the spiritual potential of every living being that, if cultivated, will manifest as innate wisdom. Through proper training of the Sanmitsu, the Three Mysteries, of the body, speech, and mind, we can reclaim Enlightenment for ourselves and to help others. One of the essential pilgrim rituals, therefore, is chanting the Heart Sutra, even if its meaning is still elusive. It reminds me of a Canadian-Indian-Muslim friend who once told me that Islam means ‘voluntary submission to God’; understanding isn’t required for salvation, just that you submit and follow the rituals. The Chinese philosopher, Confucius, also cites ritual (li 禮) as one of the five pillars of human ethics central to Confucianism (The other four are humaneness, justice, wisdom, trust). It’s a fascinating cultural parallel. Unlike a Euro-centric Enlightenment tradition of understanding the why before choosing to do something, it is to come to know something only through the doing. Wisdom can be felt through embodied experiences, beyond the reaches of the mind. We follow the henro-no-michi down the forest, a pretty path I’d have avoided on my own because of the mud. Then, it’s fields.\nFinally, we hit a Lawson, just in time for a coffee break. The other henro from the first temple this morning is also snacking outside on the bench. Over coffee and donuts, we find out he’s from Osaka and doing a one-week segment. He rushes off before we finish. Kugiri-uchi hero are usually superhuman – walking 40 kilometres a day no matter the weather, and despite painful blisters and injuries. The brief walking window imbues them with a spurt of endurance Tōshi-uchi henro who complete the pilgrimage in one go must ration.\nWhen we finish, we continue along the small town routes into Temple 59, to Kokubun-ji, the barrier temple for old Iyo Province. His wife is waiting in the parking lot when we arrive, so we do our rounds efficiently. Nakamura-san is done for today and off to his hotel, so he offers to drive me somewhere. I feel like I need to walk a little more. After Kochi, walking less than 20 kilometres feels strange.\nFrom Iyo-Sakurai, it’s a quick train ride back into town and lunch on the go. Walking makes me obsessed with food, but never as hungry as I expect to be. After that, it’s back to my hosts’ house and a warm bath.\nRefreshed, I sit in the kitchen and keep Akiko company. Unwittingly, we drift into henro talk. Soon, Akiko and I lay out our respective henro maps with single-word notes. We calculate the distances and recall tangible places as our fingers trace the lines on the page. I’m worried about climbing the mountain paths of Yokomine-ji, Temple 60, which will surely be flooded. But I have to do it to continue. In addition, I’ve made plans to stay with the mother of Noriko-san’s friend and I don’t want to cancel after they went out of their way to arrange things. It also forces me to walk tomorrow, right after the typhoon. We finally agree that tomorrow I should just do 61 to 64 and do Yokomine-ji on its own the day after. I’ll leave my stuff and come back in two days.\nReassured, I excuse myself for a nap. When I wake up, the other guests have finally made it. They caught the last train from Matsuyama before the route was shut down. The entire island is bracing for this slow-moving giant windstorm. The family of three had flown in, and still managed to visit Dogo Onsen before arriving. Impressive efficiency.\nFor tonight, Akiko has prepared a sampling of sushi, a light daikon soup, edamame, tofu, sweet corn, and home-made tempura. The young daughter is, understandably after a day of travel, more excited to play with the toys in front of the TV as her parents gush over the food.\nWe exchange backgrounds and stories over the feast. I’ve become the de facto translator between the two families who are equally curious about each other and determined to communicate despite the language barriers. The guests are quatralingual Iranian-Germans, flipping between German, Persian, and English with their daughter (who’s picked up some Japanese too). The husband owns two restaurants in Berlin, and his wife is doing PhD work in Kyushu. I’m particularly excited to reminisce about the Persian dishes my friends’ mothers cooked back in high school – nothing has compared since.\nThis family has especially come to meet Tsuneto and Akiko because of their reviews. Since Tsuneto and Akiko began hosting a year ago, they’ve hosted over 70 guests from 30 different countries. The fee they charge is donated to MSF.\nOur hosts show us the folders of the guests they’ve had. Beside the photos, I see the form I’d filled out when I first arrived. Beside the information the guests wrote, Tsuneto and Akiko have written their own annotations in Japanese. They effortlessly elaborate on every photo we ask about, filling in for each other.\nIn Chinese, there’s a term 緣分 yuanfen, which translates roughly into English as fate. Two people’s lives are threaded together, bound to meet whether by serendipity or grand design. Their threads are intertwined for as long long as this yuanfen lasts, and when they’ve spent their yuanfen, and they can drift apart.\nYuanfen captures the delights of serendipity and significance of miracle. Today, it introduced me to a clean-tech businessman even though my odds of finding any environmental or social businesses in Japan were about 0.01%. Tonight, it’s brought me back to meet this family, reconnect with childhood memories while learning about German life with an Iranian twist.\nOutside, the wind is already beating against the windows.\n"});index.add({'id':32,'href':'/book/docs/Diary-Entries/day-27/','title':"Day 27 - July 17",'section':"Diary Entries",'content':"=====\nImabari City (今治市) → Iyo-Miyoshi (伊予三芳)\nTemples: 64 Maegami-ji (前神寺), 63 Kichijō-ji (吉祥寺), 62 Hōju-ji (宝寿寺), 61 Kōon-ji (香園寺)\nWeather: Rain\nTravel Method: Train + Walking\nDistance: 8.2 (+15.8) km\n=====\nTyphoon day! It’s forecasted to make landfall tonight, so I still have the morning to visit the temples clustered around Imabari. My hosts, having walked the Ohenro themselves, urge me to get up earlier.\nThe train lines are down until at least noon.\nI finally respond to a message from Aurelie, the French henro I’d met back in Shishikui. She messaged me from Cape Ashizuri a few days ago, then disappeared after I responded when I was in Matsuyama. Her latest message asks me where I am, and that she’d take a train immediately to join me. Unfortunately, there is no train for her to catch this morning. After the trains start again this afternoon, I’ll be walking from Temples 61 to 64 and then staying at the house of Noriko-san’s friend’s mother. From that house, I will go up and down Temple 60, Yokomine-ji, and return to Tsuneto and Akiko’s house one last time in Imabari. Things ended up being a lot more complicated, but this is one of the most reassuring complications. Four days in homes, not on the street.\nKochi was the prefecture of solitude, the Dojo of Ascetic Training. Ehime is the Dojo of Enlightenment. It seems like paradise, but they seem to be things that just land my way. What have I done to deserve it?\nThe weather is a problem for sight-seeing around Imabari. Today, the won’t be going to the Shimanami-kaido, the 80km of bridges that connect Shikoku to Japan’s mainland. There isn’t much sight-seeing that’s kid-friendly. A day in is a welcome occasion for me, but for them it’s a day lost.\nIn the end, Tsuneto and Akiko ask me to translate that they can drive us there. Within 30 minutes, we all pile into the car and are off, the morning salvaged thanks once again to our hosts.\nNot long after, we’re the only group at the look-out point from the city towards the bridge. It’s a stunning vista with islands and coast a green so deep they’re almost black. In the distance, mountain ridges are water-colour painted onto the horizon. The sea is still a dark, sombre steel. The sky is a bright fluffy grey. I only learned of this bridge when translating back and forth between the two families this morning. This is the only time I’d ever come to see it, even in better weather.\nWe hop back in the car and sail across the bridge to the viewpoint on the other side. It’s a spectacular view and a quick 30 minute drive up the winding slopes. Had we taken transit and walked up, we’d have been soaked.\nIt’s about time for lunch, so we drive back into town. The Iranians treat us to curry – me the translator tag-along. After this, I head out for my mini henro walk. The rain has stopped and the trains have resumed.\nAfter a sleepy ride, I arrive at Ishizuchiyama station, which is just in front of Maegami-ji, when it begins to pour. It’s 2:30pm, which is late for a henro, and early for most people in a storm. All the temples are barely eight kilometres in total. No sweat.\nMaegami-ji was historically a temple for nobles and military families. It has since revealed for public viewing three Zaō Gongen statues, protective avatar deities associated with the religion Shugendō and are seen as local, Japanese, manifestations of buddhas and bodhisattvas. Its two flanks of covered walkways from the Main Hall feels like foot soldiers surrounding you in a courtyard. I dedicate this to a family I’m indebted to, without whom I would never have managed a foothold in Asia. Even though I get the nokyocho, I’m still unsure of whether to give it to them. The auntie has a great love of Chinese history and equal dislike for the Japanese. No family was spared the upheavals in China in the past century, or specifically Japanese occupation. But lighting incense at a Buddhist temple will hardly bridge the cultural gap she sees between the country she sees as an aggressor to her cultural homeland after a century of turbulence, wars and unequal treaties. In contrast, both my grandmothers have been to post-war Japan and one of them remembered a kaiseki meal in Kyoto even after Alzheimer’s began erasing people from her memory.\nThere’s a solitary figure heading my way. Why, it’s the henro from Osaka! It was only yesterday that I saw him at Kokubunji, nursing a limp as Nakamura-san and I left. I ask him if he really went up Yokonmine-ji this morning. He nods and puts his palm against his knees — the water was up to there. I should be careful when I go up. Having that information is reassuring. Someone survived. I continue walking in reverse order to Kichijo-ji, Temple 63, light my incense, and the move on.\nThe next temple is also down the street. It’s another small one, ordered by the Emperor Shomu in the early 8th century and destroyed, only to be restored almost a thousand years later. I dedicate this to two friends who are working against their lot to create lives for themselves. One of them is in Malaysia and the other is in Hong Kong.\nBy now, I’m rushing (why am I always rushing?) to the last temple of the day before 5:00pm. I arrive with 15 minutes left to light the incense and finish the routine before getting the nokyocho. Kouon-ji is a striking modern monster. It’s redish-brown rectangular box with pillars beside its walls, like a sarcophagus. This one I dedicated to a friend who did the same undergraduate as me. He shares a nerdy obsession with counter-narratives and subnarratives, and I think he’d be the only one amused by this building that defies the stereotypical Buddhist temple. Whomever pushed the project through probably had to fight vehement opposition. It was probably an impressive revitalisation of one of Shikoku’s oldest temples (from the 6th century) at the time that it was built, the 60s or 70s. What were they thinking then? What messages, hopes, aspirations, did they mean to signify through this architecture?\nWell, now that I’m done, I can take the train to Iyo-Mishima, where I will be staying tonight. It’s only a few blocks down from the station, but there’s no name plaque or house number. It’s a bit embarrassing ringing up the wrong house, and I begin to circle the block to see if there’s another building. Then, the door opens and a stocky woman with impeccable hair pokes her head out.\n‘Are you Ramu-san?’ She asks in a full, raspy voice.\n‘Yes, I am.’\n‘Come in, come in! I’ve been so worried about you. I didn’t know when you’d be coming with the typhoon!’\nAh, that’s right. Noriko had told me about this obaa-san few days ago, but I’d only confirmed this place last night when I knew my route. I apologise for the inconvenience caused.\n‘Nevermind, nevermind. I’ll show you your room. And the bath is ready, so you can take one after you put your things down.’\nThe house looks like a modern one from the outside, but inside, it feels more like a spacious ryoukan. The ground floor has a bathroom, an entry-way that’s stuffed with items with stories, a kitchen, a back sitting room, and her small bedroom. The hallway is narrow and wraps around each of the rooms. The second floor is accessed through a super-wide and steep stairway. Up here, it feels like a ryokan with a straight hallway flanked by sliding doors leading to four large rooms. I’m given the one at the far end, with the futon and yukata, traditional summer robe.\nIn the adjacent sitting room, there is a heavy, single-piece wooden table and a massive elephant tooth in the display corner. The other display cases have a handful of other, carefully preserved, items. I want to ask about the story behind every single piece.\nObaa-san cheerfully tells me about each and every one of them in a voice textured by age and the filled with the spirit of youth.\nAfter a while, she suggests I go take the bath while it’s still hot, since baths are filled and then covered to preserve the heat. ‘Take your time.’\nI never used to be a bath person, but I have come to love a good soak after scrubbing your body clean. In this island country that has no shortage of water, they really know how to enjoy the basic things in life.\nWhen I float back into the kitchen on a cloud of clean warmth, Obaa-san is deep-frying tempura. Dinner is a full spread of cucumber rice, egg and crab meat on more rice, tempura, pan-fried chicken, simmered eggplant and tofu, simmered konyaku and a veggie, and a variety of pickles she’s done herself. It’s an effort to finish because I spent more time eating big meals than walking today. Plus, she’s cooked enough for four. In between, I ask her about how she makes each dish, and that in turn she excitedly gets me to try her homemade pickles.\nShe makes them and gives them away to neighbours. She has a busy, active life with its own errands and social routines. Her son lives in a close-by city and she shows me pictures of her grandkids. Just then, her grandson phones and tickles her with his cute single sentences.\nPart of me wishes I could stay longer. For the evening, I can fantasise about keeping this obaa-san company, trail her through routines, learn how to make family pickles. But she has extended this hospitality to help me in my goal: Yokomine-ji. If I needed a place to settle, Noriko wouldn’t have arranged this. The best way to honour this is to move on and finish the Ohenro.\nAt 9pm, I tuck in. Even though I haven’t walked much today, a good bath and a full belly trigger rest mode. As I pull over the covers, I remember my own mantra: if you love a place, make sure to have something left unfinished so you can return.\nThere are so many things unfinished in Shikoku. I think I’ve fallen in love.\n"});index.add({'id':33,'href':'/book/docs/Diary-Entries/day-28/','title':"Day 28 - July 18",'section':"Diary Entries",'content':"=====\nIyo-Miyoshi (伊予三芳) → Imabari City (今治市)\nTemples: 60 Yokomine-ji (横峰寺)\nWeather: Sunny\nTravel Method: Walking (Train Return to Imabari)\nDistance: 26.8 (+15.8) km\n=====\n5:00am wake up. In about 10 minutes, my messy spread has disappeared into my backpack. It makes me wonder why I even have those things – even a backpack feels like an excess now. Small moments like these get me. They make me pause, feeling like I’ve shed another shell, but don’t have clear enough vision to see what the old one was like. Things are changing so fast. The thought just leaps out of nowhere.\nBut never mind, it’s 5:30am and I’m supposed to have breakfast before leaving at 6:00. I wobble my way downstairs to the kitchen. The shock of the table spread nearly blasts me back out the entrance. Obaa-san is still not done cooking, though; she needs to finish simmering the meat. I fill a small rice bowl to go with the food. I don’t know how I’ll manage this.\nBreakfast is meat, egg rolls, assorted pickles, yogurt, miso soup, rice, fruit. In the end, I couldn’t get to the fruit, which is quite expensive in Japan. There’s some meat left over. I stuffed the rest down, and I’d gladly take the left-overs as bento. I don’t ask, as I’m unsure if it’s appropriate. But, she won’t let me leave without a byodo fruit the size of a football. Smothering countryside generosity, da ne? (Insert anime head with a sweat drop.)\nI need to catch the 6:20 train down to where I last stopped to climb Yokomine-ji, the mountain temple that I’ve been avoiding.\nReluctantly, I say I should probably start walking to the station. It’s only about 5 minutes away, but I’d rather be early. She’ll have none of it – she’ll drive me all of the 200 metres. Once there, we pose for a photo. She’s ready with her back straight, hair perfect, dimples showing. She gives me a warm, parting hug. It’s funny how strangers sometimes have the tightest hugs.\nFrom the train station, I follow a snaking gentle road along a river valley. It’s glorious post-typhoon weather, when the clouds are puffy, the sky beyond is a saturated blue, the air fresh, the temperature manageable. The early morning sunlight streams through the evergreen trees that grow denser as I slowly get higher. There was a shorter, direct route from the back of Temple 61, but mornings like this are better spent beside river clearings than under dense canopies.\nI pass a henro hut and instinctively scope out whether it’s worthwhile to stay. In an alternative reality I would be here if I had not met Tsuneto, Akiko, and Noriko.\nWhere the incline gets steeper, the trail of overflowing water appears. Near the top, it fans out to cover the lane. It’s been a day since the typhoon. Is the flooding really that bad? At the end of the vehicle road, there’s a rest hut, uncleaned washroom stalls, and a waterfall gushing down a small cliff. There’s a minivan parked right in front of it, with a man loading a carload of plastic containers as they fill up. His granddaughter and wife entertain themselves in the parking lot. When he leaves, another lady working at a cafe arrives to fill her containers. For anyone who cares about tea or coffee, water is key, and mountain water is best. I’d do the same if I lived here, so I take some gulps and fill my bottle. After a quick break, I take a second staff made from a solid, polished branch with stylised burn bands. There’s a stash beside the washroom with a sign saying, ‘Please help yourself.’ Two staves will keep me from rolling my left ankle again, hopefully. I’ve changed into sandals and walk up the stairs that have disappeared underneath a stream. Let’s see what this flooded trail is made of.\nThe hike up Yokomine-ji turns out to be the funnest trail I’ve been on so far. I avoided Yokomine-ji yesterday because I didn’t want to be slipping and tripping down a flooded mountain. Going up is much easier. The dirt path quickly disappears underneath gigantic boulders, swollen streams, and dismembered branches. The shadow of the winds lingers. Even without the wreckage, this natural path disappears often compared to other mountain temples. It’s a warm-up for actual trekkers, but on the henro scale, this qualifies as a nanshou, a difficult place that tests a walking henro’s mettle. For me, it feels like going home.\nAt the top, the temple is still shrouded in a white halo of clouds, not quite mist, not direct light. Purgatory. It’s noticeably chillier at 700 metres.\nI make my quick prayers and light incense just as a group of bus henro arrive and squeeze into the narrow walkway along the slope.\nThis temple is the gateway to Western Japan’s tallest mountain: Mount Ishizuchi, one of Japan’s seven holy mountains (七霊山). It’s summit sits at 1,982 metres and has a cliff face so sheer there are a series of iron chains installed to climb up. The adventurous henro take an extra day to go here too, but I don’t have time.\nThis place reminds me of a conversation with a friend who took a picture thousands of feet above the Brazillian plateau after successfully scaling above the clouds. She laughs as she tells me how she had to figure her way up since her instructor had disappeared into the clouds and couldn’t hear her. The glorious view on top is nature’s reward for persevering through fear, doubt, and muscle aches. As I sit on the bench eating the byodou I got this morning and gulping down an ice coffee, I look up the short slope that disappears into a curtain of clouds. There’s no view of Ishizuchi from here, but I feel the call of the mountain, this mountain.\nAfter lingering, I get up to descend. I will be back — for Ishizuchi, for Shikoku.\nMountains are extreme in their temperatures, moody in their weather, breathtaking in their views, and terrifying in their heights. Mountains reflect the harsh, yet glorious realities of life. They are not conquered, only visited. They are amongst the oldest shrines of humanity – the places where ascetics, hermits, philosophers and commoners alike go to seek enlightenment. Surviving a mountain, dwelling in a mountain, is to dwell in Truth.\nEven as I turn my back, I can feel the mountain beckoning even as it settles in to wait. It’s watched aeons go by.\nI’ve been so overwhelmed with experiences recently I haven’t had the chance to takes notes until walking down. I haven’t written because there have been no words to express the things that I’ve felt the past few days. The things I notice have so much personal weight, and yet would be so negligible to anyone else.\nI’ve grown quiet. Instead, I take photos, hoping they will fill in for others the thousand words I feel no need to summon.\nToday, I finally attempt to write what I think – without explanation, without worrying about the inadequacies of language, without being discouraged that the people I want to share with won’t relate.\nI’ve always been interested in what people believe and why they believe it. That’s why I did the henro. And what people believe brings such great generosity.\nThe most profound learnings are written in a sentence because for those who have walked the same path, that’s the only direction needed; for those without the intention, more words won’t move them further.\nThese past few weeks made me realise why sages never wrote much. Their little snippets – sometimes sound flaky, sometimes sound like truisms – are…true. Any more words would dismember the wholeness with the specificity of language. Knowing how frail language is, sages often use the most fleeting of medium, speech. It is thanks to the insight of their first followers who have enough faith to take note, even before comprehension, that we can continue to interpret centuries later. It makes me think of something else: wisdom is felt. Words are felt. Felt in all its meanings, literal and metaphorical. I guess that’s why this doesn’t ‘make sense’.  I follow the paved down. It’s the long way, looping behind the mountain. It’s harder on the feet compared to soil, but there are clearings and bends that reveal valleys and lakes below. I saw the streams close-up already, so I want to take in the view from this height.\nThis continues on for a good two hours. Finally, there is a thin strip of houses and shacks at a fork. One of them is an open, rundown, restaurant and gift shop. There are some puppies playing here and two of them bound after me, chasing after my staff.\nI ignore them, not wanting to encourage anything. The owner shouts after them to come back, but they ignore her and follow me. Their mom eases herself from the shade and follows too. I round a few bends, and they’re still following. So, for now my pilgrimage includes three dogs for company. They stop whenever I stop, run ahead and wait for me, tumbling over each other as they go.\nWhen I finally turn around a bend close to town and they don’t reappear I know they’ve decided to go back. They’re trip home is almost five kilometres.\nMy thoughts return to the French henro I’ve still not seen. I wonder where she is now. I feel like my generosity is being tested. Another henro said she needed help, but my empathy for her isolation and instinct to help runs up against my desire to be alone. Also, I’m particularly wary of helping when I sense desperation. Is that selfish?\nOnce you start helping, it’s hard to stop. Sometimes it’s more damaging to stop half way, after being completely drained yourself, than to not help at all. I’m not prepared to be travel buddy, emotional support, and cultural bridge for the remainder of this pilgrimage.\nThe rest of the route is a gradual transition back into the concrete towns along the coast. It’s almost 3:00 and really hot. From Iyo-Himi station, it’s a short train ride back to Imabari.\nFirst thing is to visit the onsen. I also buy some apples to make apple crumble for Akiko and her family tonight. They’re having their weekly family dinner. I’m glad to be able to make a little something in return.\nWhen I arrive, Akiko is in the midst of cooking for more than 10 people, all her kids and grandkids. The older boys mill around, quiet, eat and then head home, not unlike my childhood family dinners. As an outsider, I finally see how cold it seems after all the effort.\nAfter dinner, I prepare the apple crumble with Akiko’s granddaughter and we realise the tray doesn’t fit in the oven after everything’s been placed. It’s a bit of a disaster, but Akiko’s daughter drives over with another tray for me. Akiko is enthusiastic and her granddaughter wants dessert, so we wait for it to finish baking past 10:30pm. It’s not ideal. It’s a typical mistake, not checking everything beforehand. Next time, I’ll come back and make something better. They all dig in anyway, exclaiming oishii, it’s tasty!\n"});index.add({'id':34,'href':'/book/docs/Diary-Entries/day-29/','title':"Day 29 - July 19",'section':"Diary Entries",'content':"=====\nImabari City (今治市) → Ishizuchiyama (石鎚山) → Iyo-Doi (伊予土居)\nTemples: None\nWeather: Sunny with Showers\nTravel Method: Walking\nDistance: 29 km\n=====\nI really wish I had enough sleep. But, I also wouldn’t trade the two extra hours we took to make the apple crumble. For a henro, a 6:30am breakfast is so late. It’s Akiko’s 365-Day Breakfast Special, in her own words. Special every day, methinks. Just as I’m finishing up, Tsuneto comes with a severe face. ‘Aa-chan, you’ll be late for your train!’ Aa-chan is the Japanese nickname a friend gave me back in June, and one that I’ve adopted for all new Japanese acquaintances. He’s worried I’ll be delayed another hour if I miss this one. Akiko hands me carefully bagged onigiri as I rush to get my stuff and hop into Tsuneto’s car so he can drive me down to the station.\nWe’re just in time. I hop off, grab my bag, and thank him once more before watching him drive off. After that, I buy my ticket and wait for the train on the platform.\nI get off at Ishizuchiyama station, where I’d left off at Temple 64 two days ago before doubling back to Temple 60, Yokomine-ji on the mountain. Complicated, but necessary for the comfortable beds!\nToday, I just follow one main road to Iyo-Doi and overnight at the station or the nearby Daishi-do. It’s under 30 kilometres, and I’ve had hearty meals and rested shoulders the past few days without a backpack. It should be manageable.\nI’m lulled into a leisurely pace, taking notice of all the little things around me from the curb to the family shops cropping up here and there. Saijo City’s spring water, known as uchinuki-no-mizu, is famously sweet, so there are fountains scattered around for us to try. I take a sip from one, and notice another just outside another rest hut. I stop at Family Marts and Lawsons to use WiFi, taking every opportunity as though it were my last today. Kochi’s scarcity has left a deep impression.\nAt one point, I see a towering M sign by the side of the strip and feel that McDonalds represents civilisation, or more accurately an area’s consumption capacity.\nAround lunch, I stop at another Family Mart where the traffic has grown denser, but the shops are thinning out. I finish the two onigiri that Akiko made, and discover a 500 Yen coin hidden in an envelope. How on earth am I ever going to repay their generosity? I can’t even get them a stamp; they’ve completed their own nokyocho book. I just sit outside taking bites of the rice balls and notice how each grain of rice is that much more distinct, the flavours more subtle, than the ones in the convenience stores that I thought were tasty enough.\nI’m soaked from head to toe with sweat, and in no mood to start walking again. The road was straightforward enough, but the concrete has proved to be harder on my feet than I thought. My feet are feeling swollen again, and the heat is becoming insufferable.\nFinished lunch, I debate on which route to take at a fork. They’re about the same distance, and I’m a bit behind. If I keep my current pace, I should just make 5pm, to ask the Daishi-do if I can stay before it closes. The simpler choice is to follow the main road which is more drab concrete and traffic, while the alternative seems more complicated but quiet. I decide on a change of scene.\nWithin an hour I regret it. I’ve wandered into a massive golf course and the sun is getting low. At this rate, I’m not making it. How it end up like this? This place only has about one road; it’s impossible to screw up.\nThe setting sun seems sinister this evening, even though it’s not yet 4:00pm. I force my way out of the golf course by opening a rusted back gate and go through a quiet village before getting back on the main road. I’m on a hill, looking down at the single route going along the coast with solitary buildings. It’s an empty expanse, made more empty by the dismal human settlement; unfettered wilderness wouldn’t have seemed so lonely. Even the pink and purple sunset, smothered by dark clouds, seems unnatural, polluted.\nI try to rush on, but my calf feels torn. How am I going to make it to Iyo-Doi? I drop my bag in front of a shuttered white wooden house with flaking paint. I’ll sit out the rain under the half-dead tree. I wish I could just pull off my drenched shirt and at least feel the light flow of air. Robbed of that freedom, I take off my shoes and let my feet breathe.\nI watch the ants crawl up my bag. They work so hard, and yet are helpless if I shake them off or squish them. I lift my bag and shake it, brushing off the few straddlers. They change directions without skipping a beat. I wish I could be like them – without the burden of thoughts, as motivated every second of the day without needing to even understand the larger system: just settle into being small to contribute to something great.\nMaybe I’ve just been spoiled for too many days. I’m pouting like a brat.\nIt’s hard to describe pain on my feet. Sometimes it’s needles. Sometimes it feels roasted, caged. Now it feels that with every step I’m squashing them into oblivion; every step is a flattening, sagging, and rebound. But because of my tight calves, my step is becoming more of a march, propped up by two staves.\nI can’t help but feel I’ve lost a mental battle, of which these physical pains are only a manifestation. What haven’t I learned yet? What am I missing?\nWhen I finally make it into the edge of town, I see a sign for stop-by showers in a hotel that’s barely holding together. I’d pay for that, except it’s closed.\nA bit further is a Lawson with a bench. I note the sleeping option. At this time of day, no matter what my eye sees, my brain only processes ‘sleeping spot’, ‘showers’ or ‘other’. Then, I see the supermarket Marunaka, which is open 24 hrs. I’ve slept in a parking lot before. I can do it again if I can find a private corner.\nI lock myself in the handicap washroom, which always has a massive sink, and wash off the sheet of stickiness from my face. I wash my shaved head in the basin and wipe my legs — close enough to a shower.\nNext, dinner is picked from the endless isles. I sit down in the lounge area to eat, which are common in supermarkets in Japan. There’s an outlet under my spot. After eating, I put my head on my arms and plan to sleep until 11pm, when the eating area closes. I prefer the bright lights and slight chill of AC to the sticky darkness outside.\nJust then, the evening sun blasts through the dark storm clouds. Oh yeah, it’s barely 7pm. Now that I’m full and finished walking, it feels like the day is still young. If I was at home, I could watch a movie and work on something on the side.\nA few hours later, a bit groggy from the sleeping and the chilly air conditioning, I go back out into the sultry night. It’s the first time I’m walking in the darkness without a headlight or street lights. It makes me realise how bright twilight is, where squinting can help me make out the details that could trip me over: small pebbles, cracks, uneaven pavement. I just walk slower and rely on the cars that race by to illuminate the next few steps for me. Thankfully Iyo-Doi’s station is close by and I find it fairly quickly.\nIt’s a spacious station and the benches are long wooden planks that are perfect for sleeping. It even has a filled bookshelf.\nI set up a sleeping spot on a corner bench, with mosquito incense on either side, lie down, with my conical hat to block out the light and hide my face. I’m facing the entrance area so I can see the streams of people going by with every train arrival. It goes from 10 people down to the remaining one or two by the last train. An old man who wandered through earlier wanders back in with company and chats for a while. I keep half an eye on them from under my hat and see him glance at me here and there as well. In Shikoku, this hat and the staff are protective charms enough. After the last train, I relax, knowing there won’t be any more traffic.\n"});index.add({'id':35,'href':'/book/docs/Diary-Entries/day-30/','title':"Day 30 - July 20",'section':"Diary Entries",'content':"=====\nIyo-Doi (伊予土居) → Shikokuchuo City (四国中央市)\nTemples: 65 Sankaku-ji (三角寺)\nWeather: Sunny with Showers\nTravel Method: Walking\nDistance: 25 km =====\n ばかはろくでもないものにかねをつかう、賢いやつはじぶんの成長のためにつかう。おとこのかちはかねの使い方でわかるもんさ。\nThe fool will spend his money on worthless things. The wise will spend his money to better himself. A man’s worth can be measured by how he spends his money.\n – Silverspoon (2013)   I wake up with the sound of footsteps outside. The station has a pale golden glow just before sunrise.\nWell, I might as well get up to air out the sweat on my back and face from sleeping. I didn’t have a blanket, but the mosquito net that I cocooned myself in traps heat.\nI eat my remaining mandarin oranges and head outside to discard the peels. The grass is damp, and the air cool with a slight breeze. The bikes parked in front of the station are still wearing glistening droplets. And there’s a double rainbow.\nMoments like these are worth getting up for. What the henro doesn’t have in material goods, we make up with plenty of moments, beautiful for their transience.\nI poke around the station to see what other views of dawn there are. There are the golden tracks that cut through the silhouette of the platform and the town. There’s the blue sky on the Western side, gleaming turquoise and cerulean.\nToday, I will reach Shikokuchuo City and Sankaku-ji, Temple 65 and the gateway to another test, Unpenji – the highest temple on the Shikoku Pilgrimage.\nIt’s a short walk – 13 kilometres – to either Shikokuchuo City or Sankaku-ji. The traditional henro path goes from Sankaku-ji up to Unpenji. In total, it would about 30 kilometres and Unpenji has a tsuyado that I can overnight in. Thirteen kilometres is too short, thirty up mountain paths is too long, and I don’t want to pay for the only ryokan in between. Anyhow, I start walking while I mull over the options. In the end, I use the same solution as I had for Yokomine-ji: shoot ahead to the next temple and double back up the mountain. I can go to Sankaku-ji, stay overnight in the city of Shikokuchuo, and walk along the coast, rather than up and down Unpenji, to the next city. I puff up at the thought.\nMy elaborate plan soon unravels. It starts with entering a covered arcade filled with shuttered stalls in the heart of Shikokuchuo City. There’s only a few stray pedestrians, locals passing the time. I knock on a dark ryokan, locked in the middle of the day.\nEventually, an elderly lady comes out and explains to me they’ve closed for 2 years and suggests other possibilities close by. The heart of this city’s hollowed out, been left behind by the bust after the 80s and stagnation.\nBased on her suggestion, I move on to the next hotel and catch the owner as she’s heading out to vacation for the summer — most ryokan and minshukus are. She passes me on to another hotel close by that’s closer to my budget.\nEven this hotel on the outside looks like a plastered cheap candy building, with a field of weeds right in front. Sigh. But didn’t I come here to see Shikoku? It includes the one ravaged by three decades of economic stagnation, which highlights another sober reality: the thousands of pilgrims, especially the vast majority trooping off of the buses, are an economic lifeline for the entire island.\nI ask for a room, and leave my things in the lobby while I go up to Sankaku-ji and back. I’ve spent too much time looking for lodgings in the city to go further than Temple 65 today.\nThe walk to Sankaku-ji quickly takes me out of the small city into the quiet hillside residential areas. Here, I rely heavily on the henro stickers to navigate the winding back roads. From there, it’s about a 5-kilometre gentle climb along the mountain slope. The first part of it remains sunny, with a breeze. There’s a rest spot with a view of the city below. The eye-catching yellow parasol, half-broken, flaps cheerfully in the wind. There’s an ancient rusted-over stove with a new kettle. Logs are cut and neatly piled for use. There’s a gurgling fountain with naturally chilled ground water. A spot from which lines of poetry can be composed over a kettle of boiling water for tea. On another day, perhaps. In another life.\nAfter this, I race to climb the muddy trail faster than the mosquitos that match my pace The henro-no-michi, the one for the heart and mind, is about letting go and learning to take things in stride. In this case, my former tolerance for them has evolved into a full-blown loathing after spending days and nights with their incessant whirling. There is only so much you can forgive when you are constantly sleep deprived.\nIf I had just sucked it up and come straight up to Sankaku-ji, I might have made it to Unpenji tonight, or at the very least stayed at the economical ryokan in the mountains, which Tsuneto and Akiko spoke highly of. Regret. Nevermind, the pilgrimage becomes personal precisely because the mistakes we make are unique to ourselves.  I’m done my rituals and gotten my nokyocho, and a slight drizzle has descended. It makes me retreat to shelter, even though I’d rather spend more time beside the gigantic pines with branches the size of trunks.\nI sit outside the stamp office while charging my phone. There’s a box of small incense containers made of paper and cardboard by elementary students, free to take, so I help myself. Although I’m always finding more things I can do without, I am growing increasingly fond of the small sentimental things – the product of gestures of good will. These weights I happily carry.\nThe lady at the stamp office tells me I should get on my way to reach Unpenji tonight. I thank her without mentioning I’m going back to the city. Although I enjoy practicing my Japanese, I feel less and less inclined to speak. Silence is so vast and nuanced, still, clear, subtle. It’s a good place to dwell. The way back is still somehow tiring. Maybe it’s just the heat, or last night’s broken sleep. I’m no longer interested in the surrounding areas. They’re places, markers of distances.\nI pass a gaunt looking man who looks older than he should be. He’s a walking henro too, but he’s taken a break. He runs into his house to grab his staff. We chat some more about where we’ve been, which routes were hardest, the usual. I want to get going as I’m getting hungry, but don’t quite want to stop him. Just then, a car stops and someone calls out him. While they chat, I use the opportunity to excuse myself. But he wraps up quickly and hands me 300 Yen. He motions to the vending machine in front and says, get a drink for yourself. O-settai. His day is done, and he’s acknowledging that mine isn’t yet.\nI finally reach the supermarket complex. The sun is still high despite the gathering clouds. It’s barely 4pm. But henro can eat whenever they want, whatever they want, which today includes ice cream. I devour the meal and decide to return to a store in the shopping arcade earlier. But first, I need a haircut – there’s a cheap barber shop outside. I ask them if they can finish shaving my head in 30 minutes. Barbers here take their profession seriously, so it could take longer than five minutes. The man who does the cut, unconvinced a girl wants such a short one, keeps showing me successively shorter blades until I finally am satisfied. The major cut is over in minutes, but he takes great care to clip the remaining fray bits at my nape and ears. By the time he’s done, I feel like a weight has been lifted.\nI’m off to the shop to get the silk placemats at the shop with unbelievable local prices. It’s unfortunate economy is so bad here. Many of the crafts I’ve seen here are done with great care. The elderly shop lady shows me pictures and guides, in black and white, of her henro journey decades ago when the roads were not yet paved. I thought I came back for omiyage, souvenirs, but it might have been for this story. Back at the hotel, I go about the errands — shower, laundry, dry laundry. Just having a tidy room to do the routine is soothing. I finish just in time for sunset from the window. The sky is a flaming gold brushes along the contours of the dark clouds showering on the hills. Sky drama. I’m content to just watch it unfold as the minutes pass by. Beauty is so moving.\nWhen glow begins to dim, I return to drying my clothes. It’s been a hard day. I’ve gotten used to it, but it never gets easier. It just gets done.\nThis is the last of Ehime Prefecture, the Dojo of Enlightenment. Perhaps enlightenment came too quickly, too easily, a mirage of sorts. Tomorrow, I will enter the last prefecture, Kagawa, the Dojo of Nirvana – whatever Nirvana means, I want to find out.\n"});index.add({'id':36,'href':'/book/docs/Diary-Entries/day-31/','title':"Day 31 - July 21",'section':"Diary Entries",'content':"=====\nShikokuchuo City (四国中央市) –\u0026gt; Kanonji City(観音寺市)\nTemples: 68 Jinne-in (神恵院), 69 Kannon-ji (観音寺), 70 Motoyama-ji (本山寺)\nWeather: Cloudy + Drizzles\nTravel Method: Walking (+Car, Cable Car, Train)\nDistance: 19.2 (+40) km\n=====\nTwo big, heavy, onigiri courtesy of the hotel! I stow them in my backpack and finish the rest of my cheese and bread breakfast in the lobby. The guest laundry is waving outside on the veranda.\nI message friends using the hotel WiFi. An hour disappears. The more I sit, the harder it is to dislodge myself. I’d originally planned to detour two kilometres for an onsen en route, but I probably won’t have time anymore. To a summer nojuku henro, a bath probably tops treat list. There are so many options for sleeping: a park, a michi-no-eki, a 24-hour manga cafe, unattended train stations. But there are few public showers in Shikoku. Is my Whatsapp conversation really worth it? It feels like I’ve traded a henro necessity for unnecessary temptation for another life of preoccupations and relationships. Lives come in packages. Technology has already made these compartmentalisations more flexible, given us lifelines to support networks outside. Smartphones suited with Wi-Fi puncture brief holes in the henro bubble. Yet, the puncture can sometimes be a painful deflation. The walking henro bubble-package includes early rises, hours of walking, temples, planning food and water, hunting for accommodation, and onsen. This myopia keeps us going day after day. Yet, they are priorities our friends can’t share with us.\nThe morning heat is trapezing in the open glass door. I finish my conversation abruptly and slather sunscreen as fast as I can. It’s 7:30am. I really need to go.\n Family Mart! I’ve only been walking an hour or so, but I couldn’t resist the air conditioned comfort and seats. Plus, I need water. I sit, checking my messages again. I know should be saving this longer break for noon, when the sun is at its worst, but this route through empty towns makes me complacent. It’s just a straight road along the coast to Kanonji-City. I’m armed with an umbrella and sedge hat to block most of the sun. Tourist henro coming through!\n Crap, did I scew up my packing? Why is my shoulder aching already? I’ve stopped at another michi-no-eki that’s facing the sea. A metal plaque gives the heat-bleached islands names. Down the coast is a steady smattering of buildings.\nI sit on the covered bench and snack again, eying the sparrows feeding their young in the nests above me. They’ve already decorated most of the area with white droppings. The colony of parents race back and forth between the grass and the little beaks sticking out of the thatched homes. I take off my soaked socks and flex my toes to the cool breeze while snacking.\nI’ve seen these birds before on an organic farm. The chicks there barely had their beaks out when I arrived and by the time I left almost two weeks later they were barely fitting in the cramped nest. That was in northern Kyoto when tsuyu, the rainy season, began. It’s high summer now.  Okay, the heat is really getting to me. Suburbia is getting to me. My backpack is getting to me. My irritation is getting to me – and it’s barely noon. I look longingly at a quaint cafe nestled in the shade with a natural wood interior and European-style seats. In the city, it would be idyllic countryside, but in the middle of nowhere, this becomes urbanite romanticism. It’s not time to stop yet, so I march reluctantly on, shelving my city roots.\nI’m in the last prefecture. There’s a noticeable pile of previously imperceptible changes now. I stop on the sidewalk to capture some of the floating bits. If you drop me in Kochi now I’d be wiser, but not stronger. My shoulder no longer hurts. I have a good pace.\nI was eating to shed weight — three bananas this morning so I don’t have to carry them, bought yogurt to finish extra cereal. Onigiri. My descriptive skills have atrophied. No. They’re to the point. The points are all I need. Sentences unnecessary.\nThere’s another konbini, so I scurry in. It’s just past noon, an insane time to walk. Plus, the underside of my sedge hat is coming apart. It was half broken when I adopted it in Temple 1. Please, just last one more day.\nI can only walk normally with a bag now. My gait becomes a waddle the moment I drop my backpack near the entrance of the konbini. I feel the tightness in my legs, my sore butt. I wish I could see myself. I’d laugh.\nWith second lunch, I plant myself on the seats, basking in AC – not good for sweating muscles. My soaked shirt and shorts become cold weights. I’m caught between feeling guilty for ‘wasting time’ and acknowledging the rest my body is demanding. Oh well. What will be, will be. I begin eating and flipping through messages.\nWhen I finally do get up, I feel as light as when I started this morning. What a miracle my body has pulled off in an hour. I wish I could see the minute-by-minute regeneration. My spirits are reset to high. What a grouch I was. I’m glad to have a more bubbly self as I set off for the final stretch to Kanonji City.\n It’s 3:00pm and I’ve just finished Temples 68 and 69, which are right beside each other. Actually, I mixed up their Daishi Halls, the secondary shrines dedicated to Kobo Daishi because they’re in the same complex. The contrast between the Main Halls, though, is stark. One has a modern, concrete entrance climbing up to the Main Hall, and a large new building for its offices. The other one seems like an attachment, had it not been for the nondescript sign with the temple name. Nonetheless, one person writes both nokyochos for me.\nI sit under the umbrella of a leafy tree in the middle of the courtyard, wondering if these two temples form a block in quiet competition with the Shinto shrines above and below them. I had read that Temple 68 used to be beside the Shinto shrine below, a typical coexistance between Buddhism and Shinto. The Meiji Era changed that by declaring Shinto as Japanese nation’s ‘native’ religion and forced the institutions to separate.\nThis hill has many family tombs, no doubt from before that separation. Do the families visiting now have allegiances or do they not care? As I leave, I look up at the torii, the red square arches of the Shinto shrine. Despite its simple design it has a similar concept to the Buddhist Niōmon, the gate marking entrance to sacred grounds. You find shimenawa, spiritual ropes, wrapped around many trees on Buddhist grounds. Whatever divisions were imposed seems an arbitrary act of nation-building.\nI’m in the ryokan after returning from Temple 70, Motoyama-ji. I’m hungry and tired, but also bathed. Laundry is done. I delay tucking in and let my thoughts swirl. I was lucky that the owner came back for a lunch break minutes after I arrived at the locked ryokan. It looked closed for the holidays, like the ryokans in Shikokuchuo City where I came from. When she discovered me, she said she’d prepare a room for this evening and take my bag as I walked to Temples 68, 69 and 70. Without baggage and a close walk to the first two temples, I thought I had plenty of time and hung around under the tree in the courtyard, waiting for the sun to wane. I even went hunting for an ice coffee in a nearby supermarket and sat down outside with the intention to sip it when I discovered it was almost 4:00pm. My last walk was an hour away if I walked fast. The coffee was dealt with in a gulp and I raced along the river towards the last temple. Gentle stroll indeed! I speed-walk along the river that never seemed to reach its destination, giving envious glares to cyclists racing by, imagining myself like an anime character knocking them over to borrow the bike, do my rounds, and then return it before they recover from the shock.\nMy muscles and tendons aren’t sore anymore; they are tearing with every step. I limped into the large temple compounds about ten minutes before closing, filled with thoughts of catching buses and trains. It was the first time I got the nokyocho before finishing the rituals. Shikatanai. There’s no choice if I wanted to get it for the friend I am dedicating it to, but I still felt guilty for doing things out of order. The ojii-san in the office wasn’t that keen to help, even after he finally heard what I needed: the nokyocho on a piece of paper. The gap between articulation, understanding, and willingness can sometimes be impassable canyons.\nFortunately, the lady who was sweeping the grounds returned just in time and offered to help. After she wrote it, she asked me the usual questions about my background. Then, she presented me with a brocade osamefuda, casually saying that it might be a good omiyage, souvenir for friends. What an understatement! Silver and gold osamefuda are dug out of temple boxes by henro looking for lucky charms. Brocade osamefuda, used by henro who completed over 100 rounds, cannot be given to someone who doesn’t understand their significance. I was over the moon when I received one at Temple 55. I don’t deserve two.\nBut, she was giving an o-settai, so I could not refuse. I limped to my bag to get an osamefuda for her, the protocol when henro receive o-settai. Could a piece of paper really convey the heartfelt gratitude? I had to believe she could feel it as it passed between us. The corner of her eyes creased as she smiled under her surgical mask. My memory of her has an evening halo as she bowed a goodbye under the doorway, her broom in hand.\nWhen I am grateful for the things I’ve received, I’ve always needed to give something useful or meaningful back. I am happy to give, but don’t like being indebted. Walking this pilgrimage, the tables have been turned. It’s made me realise that my reciprocation of favours has kept my appreciation and gratitude to a thought rather than a feeling. Unconditional generosity, so rare in our increasingly self-absorbed lives, in such abundance in Shikoku is humbling and disarming. I’ve read that character is how you treat people who can do nothing for you. These people who don’t have much to give but manage so much in the way of giving. Here I’ve learned to feel gratitude and humility deeply. You realise how vulnerable you are, how much you needed what was offered to you only after you receive it.\nAnyhow, that’s enough thinking for today. I slip under the warm covers.\nI haven’t even gotten to my ryokan host. She’s an interesting one too – but I’ll leave that for tomorrow. She’s driving me to the trailhead of Unpen-ji, the highest temple in the Shikoku Pilgrimage, tomorrow. It’s her o-settai.\n"});index.add({'id':37,'href':'/book/docs/Diary-Entries/day-32/','title':"Day 32 - July 22",'section':"Diary Entries",'content':"=====\nKanonji City (観音寺市) → Fureai Park-mino (ふれあいパークみの)\nTemples: 66 Unpen-ji (雲辺寺), 67 Daikō-ji (大興寺), 71 Iyadani-ji (弥谷寺)\nWeather: Cloudy + Drizzles\nTravel Method: Walking (+Car, Cable Car, Train)\nDistance: 19.2 (+40) km\n=====\nIt’s 8:10am and I drop my bags on Jizo’s lap. This is the same Jizo statue I’d always give a nod to even when I was reduced to mechanical reflex by heat and exhaustion. Why were there so many benches at the base of the trail and none up here when you really need it?\nDespite getting a ride to the trailhead of Unpen-ji, by the time I got out my mosquito incense just 15 minutes after starting I was in a foul mood. It only got worse. I’m tired, and I just started. I walked into my hotel grinning after being drenched in Kochi, but now everything irritates me. I hate the plastic bag with my o-settai sandwich and the noise it makes when it knocks against my hand. I hate the mosquitos hovering in front of my eyes, and its incessant buzz in my ear the moment the wind blows the mosquito incense off.\nFuck them.\nWhen did I start cursing like this?\nI wouldn’t have gotten this far this early without the o-settai drive from the ryokan owner, who often hikes this trail with her husband.\nLast night, we had a few extended conversations as she was eager to practice her Mandarin with me. I asked her then if I could leave my bag at the ryokan while I walked to Unpen-ji. Her expression changed and she suggested it’s more comfortable if I stay another night. Unpen-ji has a tsuyado, and if I was going to take it easy, I’d rather stay up there tonight. I told her so. Her eyes widened in surprise before her face sank into resignation. She didn’t know about temple tsuyados, which is understandable since she wouldn’t have reason to use one as a local.\nI didn’t know if she had made the suggestion because she was worried about me or if she was hoping for a bit of business. Probably both, and I can’t blame her. Summer is slow she and her husband both need jobs to support the family. After a bit of consideration, she said, ‘Then why don’t I drive you?’\n‘But I won’t be coming back…’ I didn’t want to create a misunderstanding.\nHer eyes wideneded again. ‘That’s okay! It’s my o-settai.’\nI got up this morning when it was still dark outside, ate a quick breakfast, packed, and went downstairs to wait for my ride. I leave my sedge hat because the inner frame has broken off, but it looks good as a display piece.\nThe ryokan owner was in the kitchen cutting away. ‘Good morning. Sorry, please wait a moment, I’m just finishing this.’\nNo problem, I was just grateful for a ride out of the city in this drab weather. I watched the cats on the window sill. She adopted three over the years, amongst the many strays around town.\nWhen she finished, she handed me the sandwich and said, ‘O-settai.’ Surprised, I took it and thanked her. She hesitated, then mentioned the payment.\nOf course! I wasn’t sure when to pay after we put it off last night. I got out the bills, asking her for a receipt. She disappeared and returned with too much change. Surprised again, I asked her if I had misheard her quote from last night.\n‘Yes, yes. It’s a discount.’ She must have remembered my arched brows last night when she told me the price for sudomari, a room without meals. It was more expensive than the ryokan next door, which was well rated.\nShe didn’t have to do that, but I took the change. People can only stay kind if we let them.\n The path up is dark, strewn with the casualties of the recent typhoon. The trees are disemboweled and their carcasses are strewn everywhere. Amputated branches and mutilated trunks block the path. Under the dim canopy, the unkept trail looks morose, waiting for time to bury its wounds. Japanese forest trails are usually in troughs, which means they take an extra day to dry. The mud clings to my cloth runners, dragging my every step. On a sunny autumn day, it would be a picturesque golden tunnel.\nI grit my teeth. The pilgrimage’s highest temple will be finished. It’s only 800 metres above sea level.\nNear the top, I pass two separate walking henro. I admire their tenacity. Slowly inching down in this mud and wreckage is more nerve-wracking and tenuous than stumbling up. Yet, I can only muster a mumbled ‘hello’ and ‘be careful’. I am using all my will to refrain from shouting into the hills in frustration. I think I’ve gone crazy.\nOpen space and light. A turn and everything is mist. I’ve reached the other side of the mountain.\nIn a few minutes I’m passing the Gohyaku rakan, almost-life-sized stone statues of the 500 Disciples of the Buddha, similar to the saints and apostles of the Judeo-Christian tradition. The 500 are only found in China and Japan. These faces reflect the celebrated individuals who come from all over East, South-East and South Asia. Whether the severe monk, the serene priest, the drunkard, the insane mystic, or the fierce warrior, their strong characters and intense postures exude a touch of divinity.\nDroplets begin splattering around, so instead of lingering and studying their faces in turn, I continue following flat road wrapping around the side of the mountain.\nAn ojii-san henro emerges, and by now I’ve regained enough composure to warn him about the fallen trees and slippery mud. It’s summer and the handful of us still walking need to look out for each other. Message delivered, I excuse myself.\n‘Wait a moment,’ he says and digs into his pocket.\n‘O-mamori.’ For protection. He hands me the small charm, a bell with a pile of pink bottle gourd. I give him my osamefuda in exchange before we part ways.\nI was tempted to buy this exact charm several times. The bottle gourd has spiritual significance for both the Chinese and Japanese. It is associated with wanders, mystics, drunkards, poets, the insane, and the immortal. Distinct, understated, and divine. Plus, it’s cute.\nAs in legends, a being emerges from the mist with a gift and a riddle and fades back in with a laugh before you can even respond.\nThe henro-no-michi knows me better than I know myself. Here, it seems to say, take all you want. I’ll take care of things; now go figure yourself out. Keep going.\nIn truth, arriving at Unpen-ji is almost like an afterthought. The serenity of the soaked and foggy grounds came with the chilliness of the mountain seeping into my clothes, wet from sweat and rain.\nIt takes me a while to light the incense in the temple flame provided, which is doggedly surviving the wind and rain. Eventually it’s done, and I wander down the elegant stone slabs to the other hall to repeat the ritual. Temple 66 was a great centre of learning in the Kamakura Period and reportedly the inspiration behind Chosokabe‘s quest to conquer all of Shikoku (and then burn down most of its temples, Unpen-ji included). The elaborate size, finish, and detail in the current wooden structures reflect the devotion of those who rebuilt and maintained it.\nYet, the spirit of the temple wasn’t in the structures, it is in mists that flow through the trees. It is named the temple on the edge of the clouds, after all.\nAfter I get the nokyocho, I walk to the cable car station. Arriving just after the cut off to board, I enjoy my o-settai sandwich outside with a clear view of the sea of clouds below. From here, I watch the sky currents sweep through, cover, uncover, re-cover, the peaks and ranges. What truths are revealed from this vantage of heaven? I’ll have to find out next time. The cable car has returned.\nAfter sailing down down the mountain, it is a smooth walk weaving down the hills to Temple 67. The forest and rivers slowly begin to accommodate settlements, then finally open out into the suburban fields. I take note of the well-kept tsuyado and rest hut that I walk past even though I won’t stop yet. All places of shelter are significant in a henro’s mental map.\nI am walking fast, but my arches are collapsing. My calf is tearing. Tomorrow, I will need to take a shorter walk. My leg is torn by the time I get down to Temple 67. Bah, but I’m on schedule!\nYou cannot miss the massive camphor tree, which is reportedly planted by Kukai himself, that sweeps over the stairs leading up to the temple.\nI finish the usual routine, then sneak out the back entrance, which they didn’t want me to enter from. Having gone around once, I’d rather save 15 minutes of pain and get right out onto the correct street to catch the bus. If I miss this one, I will either have to wait two hours or walk to the train station (the faster alternative).\nBy 9:42am I am at the bus stop with a celebratory can of ice milk coffee. I made it! The rushing was worth it. Now, I’ll sit my way to my last temple today: Iyadani-ji.\nBy late afternoon, I have finished my temple routine at Iyadani-ji. It’s on a small hill with a view of the plains reaching the sea. Its areas of worship are staggered between steep stairs that eventually lead to the new(er) Main Hall. The entire complex seems to have grown out of the hill, the small buildings and shrines, statues, holy waterfall, and trees included. The Daishi Hall is built into a grotto with one wing for the gold-inlaid altar and another one leading to a large cave-cemetery. I get my nokyocho here, in the elegant tatami-matt hall. I ask the office for the tsuyado, which is on an updated Japanese nojuku henro list. The man I’m facing gives me a look and says stiffly, ‘We don’t have one.’\nIt is too late to move on to the next temple, which also reportedly has one. I do something out of character: I ask again and show him the list, which is effectively the official list from Spring.\nHe barely glances at it and repeats what he said.\n‘What about the rest building down the hill?’ I ask.\nNo.\nNo explanation. It would be fine if it was like the Daishi-do in Kochi where the patron decided to stop hosting. Something is off about this man’s expression, different from the aloof monks in Kochi. There’s something about his eyes, how he wrote my stamp, something unwelcoming.\nI get my bag and go down to the onsen just down the hill to make use of my coupon, and wash away the bruises of the day.\nBy late evening, I’ve enjoyed my fill of the onsen waters and am sitting in the lounge area. I dig into the snacks a worker at the michi-no-eki shop ran out to give me. Despite all the walking, I sometimes eat less than I used to in the office. I eat because I know it’s time to, before I’m hungry. In Chinese, they say people who don’t need to eat have become faeries. I guess heat inspires faery appetites.\nFinished, I wander downstairs to sleep on the reclining lounge chairs until the onsen closes at midnight, thanks to the advice of the cleaning lady. At midnight, I go outside, zip myself into my mosquito net, and lie down on the bench in a covered nook beside the main entrance.\nI can feel the occasional breeze through the mesh. At some point, the downpour begins. Faeries also don’t sleep much.\n"});index.add({'id':38,'href':'/book/docs/Diary-Entries/day-33/','title':"Day 33 - July 23",'section':"Diary Entries",'content':"=====\nFureai Park-mino (ふれあいパークみの) → Utazu (瀬戸大橋四国健康村)\nTemples: 72 (Mandara-ji 曼荼羅寺), 73 (Shusshakaji 出釈迦寺), 74 Kōyama-ji (甲山寺), 75 (Zentsū-ji 善通寺), 76 (Konzō-ji 金倉寺), 77 (Dōryū-ji 道隆寺)\nWeather: Sunny with Clouds\nTravel Method: Walking\nDistance: 24.8 km\n=====\nLast night averaged out alright. After being turned away by Iyadani-ji, I relaxed in the onsen down the hill, snacked on o-settai cookies, napped on a lounge chair until midnight, and found a covered bench beside the onsen entrance, sheltered from the rain, as my final sleeping spot. What more could I ask for?\nIt’s another night in the memory bank. Time passed, not quickly, not slowly, not relaxed enough to sleep, not uncomfortable. In the past weeks, I’ve drifted in and out of sleep to stopping trucks, night travellers, noisy branches, animals, temperature fluctuations, and street light automations. Even if still foreign, the nocturnal world is growing on me.\nBefore I know it, day arrives. I turn my back to it and squeeze in my last sleep hour during twilight. Eventually, I push myself up from the bench. It’s time to go when it’s bright enough to see in the forest that I must cross this morning.\nThe rhythm of the falling rain is captivating, but it also spears leaves off trees, turns soft soil into clingy mud, and breeds the mosquitos buzzing around my ears.\nI stop often to record my intense feelings, which catch me off guard.\nThe same bamboo that had enchanted me in Tokushima now is just a slippery obstacle. I regret taking the mountain road. I crawl down the 100 metres. A kilometre feels like forever.\nDespite nojuku bringing broken sleep, I’ve never felt the grogginess and headaches that gripped me in the city if I didn’t sleep enough. Despite twisting stiffly all night, my legs revive when I begin to walk. Somehow, this body still works. I think my body more at home in this pilgrimage than I am, operating like an SUV surviving its rookie driver off-road.\nMy mind registers without thinking. Tall bamboo. Mud trough and slippery leaves. Fallen bamboo and trees. Blocked path. Lake clearing. Cow mooing in a clearing. Out of drinking water. A house with a white and red roof in the European style. The stagnant green ponds look idyllic beyond the tall grasses. The path is overgrown. Too few henro feet have passed. Shoes get wet fastest in wet grass.\nBut my body is still overstretched. It heals fast, but not well. After the initial hours, my ankles and calves begin to tear again.\nSince my left ankle sprain back in Kochi, I’ve learned to avoid and dislike the mountain roads that I once sought out. Now, every time I trace an off-road trail on my map, I get anxious. My once confident strides are reduced to small, tentative steps.\nJust one more week and it’s over. Thank God. I like challenges. I still do, but now the distances feel like forever.\nWhen I finally make it out onto the road, it’s morning traffic. I duck into a Family Mart for breakfast. I promised my legs a break today. I’ll just cover the cluster of temples in Zentsuji City, take a train if necessary. I message Aurelie and tell her where I’m headed. She messages back telling me she’s found company and is ahead of me. How?\nAfter 7:30am, I head to the first temple about fifteen minutes away. There’s supposed to be a restaurant beside it with o-settai udon for walking henro. I’m hanging around for that.\nAt the temple, there’s one other henro – in long-sleeves and pants!! – just heading out. We exchange greetings and he leaves. There aren’t even bus henro to liven up the place; they petered out after Kochi.\nI make my prayers, pick up a nokyocho, and ask the stamp office whether they have a tsuyado, an overnight place for henro. It was listed in my updated Japanese nojuku henro guide. If this place says yes, I can wash the sour taste from yesterday’s encounter at Iyadani-ji. Mandara-ji’s office also says sternly that there is no tsuyado. The tea place on the temple grounds isn’t one. The man’s impassive look isn’t like the expressionless monks in Kochi. It’s off. It’s like the one I saw yesterday, like there’s more to that ‘no’. Temples aren’t obligated to have tsuyado, so I’m more disappointed by my nagging doubt.\nThe next temple is just 15 minutes walk away. I repeat my ritual, dedicate it to another friend. This temple is endearingly haphazard, with a worn bell tower, a friendly rough-around-the edges rest area for henro, and an office-shop assembled as an afterthought.\nI see the fellow walker again on a smoke break. So he rushes from temple to temple to chill on a cigarette. It’s funny what we all stop for.\nHe seems the quiet type, so I just nod. As I’m packing, he walks over and hands me his details on his osamefuda. ‘If you are ever in Kyoto, or need anything, please get in touch.’\nI look at the slip. It’s written in a very shaky hand, and I can’t make out all the characters, but I appreciate the thought. I give him mine in return.\nAs he finishes his smoke, I ask him if he’s planning to get udon at the shop down the street. He says he heard of it, but couldn’t find it.\nEH?! There’s only one sign in front of the only shop above Mandara-ji. I invite him to come with me if he’s not in a rush. I’m a bit surprised when he agrees.\nWe retrace our steps and poke our heads into the shop. The door is open now and the owner invites us to sit if we don’t mind waiting. A free sample of Kagawa’s most famous product, Sanuki udon? Of course, I’ll wait. We leave our bags outside and sit down.\nBy now, Kouhei’s told me that he’s walking the pilgrimage for his late grandfather and his family background. At a distance, he looked like a student, but close up, it’s apparent his work and worries have taken a toll on his baby face. He has a kind, if shy and anxious, air so I try to compensate with silly stories and light laughter.\nWe admire the patchwork of white and time-stained osamefuda slips that may as well be wallpaper. It’s like we’re eating out of a storage house, one with nokyocho from the 20 Bangai temples, additionally significant temples not part of the official route, and cute posters of Japanese idioms that I ask Kouhei to help me read.\nAs we run out of topics, the two bowls of plain udon arrive with soy sauce. The owner comes out to explain why plain is best. Of course he’d say that, but when I take a bite I am convinced. The noodles are springy and chewy, with the subtle sweetness of the starch balanced with the saltiness in the dashi-soy sauce. Any toppings are distractions.\nWhen done, we both leave osamefuda to add to the collection. The couple is close to retirement age. I wonder if this place will soon only live in our memories. Or, perhaps, this noodle shack will still have our nameslips after we are long gone. Who knows?\nKouhei also orders a box of udon omiyage for his family, with next day delivery for only 600 Yen.\nNext up is Koyama-ji. I watch Kouhei’s ritual, noting how he does the same things I do in entirely different ways. Despite seeing hundreds of henro over the past month, this is the first time walked and prayed with a walking henro. What are they like? Despite being one, I don’t know.\nWe continue on to Zentsu-ji, the namesake of the city. It is the family temple of Kobo Daishi and taking up two massive city blocks is the largest walkable temple complex in the pilgrimage, and a major stand-alone attraction. After walking back and forth a few times, checking out the statues, and admiring the buildings, we escape the bustle.\nI’m looking forward to a break soon. Without my sedge hat, which finally broke yesterday, the sun is directly on my head. Also, I want to try more Sanuki udon since we’re here. Sanuki is the old name for Kagawa Prefecture, and this is the home of one of Japan’s most beloved comfort foods.\nWe reach Temple 76, do our prayers and hang out in the large rest building. Kouhei pulls an energy-drink and me an onigiri. We’re a pretty shabby, under-eating pair. I pass my extra one to him.\nAfter, I ask Kouhei to help book a place called Magnanimity Inn, charging walking a mere 1000 Yen. Most ryokans even in these parts are at least 4000. There’s no pickup, so we go for a 2000 Yen backup at an onsen. Kouhei normally doesn’t make arrangements until the end of the day, so he’s happy to tag along. I have all the directories and lists he doesn’t have (in Japanese) and no phone to call with. We make a good pair.\nThen, we’re onto today’s last temple, Dōryū-ji. By now, my left arch and calf is torn. Knowing how overly considerate Japanese can be, I adjust my step so that I don’t limp visibly.\nJust outside the temple, there are two men standing outside their house, waiting for us. They hand us small clay figurines and explain that they’re an artisanal family, interviewed even by the current Prime Minister Abe. So they are the source of these little Jizo figures! Cute!\nAfter we finish our rituals at Dōryū-ji, we have 5 kilometres to our lodgings. It’s straight down the sprawl of small cities along the waterfront. After a bit of limping, I tell Kouhei to go ahead. He has walked over 40 kilometres today, starting from Kanonji City! He needs a break.\nHe responds in his halting way, ‘No rush. We’re done for today, so it doesn’t matter when we arrive. It’s better to walk together.’\nI’m struck by his answer. I don’t know what weighs on his mind, but he has a transparent face. He means it. I’ve often thought the exact same thing after 5pm and the temples close. It must be henro truth. Another henro practice is that people go at their own pace to arrive at an agreed upon location.\nI guess we’ve decided to walk far together today. Without him, I wouldn’t have made it here now.\nIf he’s staying, he’s coming with me to a konbini for a snack. After lots of online map consulting, we finally find one and he comes back out with an ice cream sandwich.\n‘O-settai,’ he says, simply.\nHe’s returning the onigiri I gave him earlier. Despite being like this myself, I’m a bit surprised. I take a bite of the waffle ice cream sandwich. Then another. Then it’s gone. That was so good!\nHe smiles hesitantly, isn’t it?\nThere’s something creepy about the empty, gridded streets with gigantic games, entertainment, and pachinko buildings close to our onsen. I’m happy to forget them when we finally enter the onsen. We make our payments and part ways with a general matta, later then. If it’s meant to be, we’ll meet again.\nAn hour later, I’m reborn into clean onsen robes. Now, I need dinner. Upstairs at the vending machines, I see a tall Caucassian guy with a bandaged nose. It’s the henro I’d seen up in Kuma Kogen! This must be Edvaldo, the guy Kouhei told me he met along with ‘a French girl’, Aurelie, in Unpen-ji’s tsuyado!\nI introduce myself.\nThe rest of the night is bubbling reunions, hugs, photos and updates. Edvaldo, Aurelie, Kouhei and I chat through dinner in the restaurant in our mix of French, English, and Japanese.\nEdvaldo came to do the pilgrimage with no Japanese skills or guides. It’s a wonder he persisted after all the misunderstandings, language barriers, and technology problems. It echoes Aurelie’s experience. She also updates me on her journey since Shishikui with the highs and lows since Cape Ashizuri.\nSomehow, Edvaldo and I begin discussing Kagawa. He’s heard from Japanese henro that they find Kagawa strange, and that the prefecture has a history of discouraging foreign henro. He cites examples of henro arrow stickers purposely stuck to misguide and anti-Korean graffiti. That suddenly explains the looks I got at the temple offices. I’m relieved. I can live with a sad reality, not the feeling of suspicion I had earlier.\nWe’ll walk together from now on. Except Edvaldo, who fainted in the onsen and needs to return to Canada. He’s so close, too. There’s really no guarantee until the last step is taken, a sobering thought.\nYet, Edvaldo wants to treat Kouhei and me to a capsule unit so that we can sleep better than in the common area. When I translate for Kouhei, he accepts with the usual ‘sumimasen’ and bow. I’m tempted, but protest. Edvaldo doesn’t need to be polite; he’s just met me.\n‘You’re not supposed to refuse an o-settai.’ Edvaldo chides cheerfully and ambles off to make the upgrade.\nA bed is…priceless. Do I have anything to give in return, something that won’t weigh him down, but a suitable souvenir of his adventure? Suddenly, I remember the brocade osamefuda. Brocade osamefudas are used by henro who have done the pilgrimage over 100 times and highly prized. I had received one each from Temple 55 and Temple 70 as o-settai, but felt one was enough. The other was meant to be given away.\nWas this the right occasion? Is a 3000 Yen sleep worth this? Or, is it exchanging two priceless and incomparable things? What’s the meaning of giving this, to me, to him?\nHolding them, the reasons crystalise. I want him to remember what he accomplished already, and to remember to finish what he started. Too often we say one day, some day, then we let life get in the way. There is no better motivation than a piece of a henro who has completed the pilgrimage over a hundred times.\nOsamefuda in hand, I go upstairs to give it to Edvaldo and go sleep.\nWhen I put it on the table, his eyes widen.\n‘I thought this might be something you’d like…’ Despite my hesitant nervousness, I am relieved by his reaction. He knows.\nEdvaldo had received one, too. It came from the original owner who mustered the courage to chat with him. Edvaldo, in turn, gave it away to another ojii-san who has yet to embark on his lifelong dream.\nI’m speechless. We’re both speechless. It’s hard not to believe in fate when it took so many coincidences that fell into place, and so many uncanny parallels.\nWe continue talking on late into the night. It will cost me tomorrow, but I want to savour this moment. Eventually, we say goodnight, leaving farewell for tomorrow.\nAll you can do is hope that it was worth it to give a piece of yourself away. Whether it is known, acknowledged, received, or appreciated is important, but not the motivation. We give what we can. If we put our hearts into it, what we can give just might be exactly what someone else needs. "});index.add({'id':39,'href':'/book/docs/Diary-Entries/day-34/','title':"Day 34 - July 24",'section':"Diary Entries",'content':"=====\nUtazu (瀬戸大橋四国健康村) →Goshikidai Plateau Henro Hut (五色台遍路小屋)\nTemples: 78 Gōshō-ji (郷照寺), 79 Tennō-ji (天皇寺), 80 Sanuki Kokubun-ji (讃岐国分寺), 81 Shiromine-ji (白峯寺), 82 Negoro-ji (根香寺)\nWeather: Sunny\nTravel Method: Walking\nDistance: 29 km\n=====\nAll the other capsules remain silent as I crawl out of my cozy unit-bed. The room is a contained darkness lit by a glow of mini LEDs on the floor. I push open the door and exit into the lit world with carpets and pastel beige colours. I pop downstairs to the onsen for a morning soak, pack my bag, and I’m out in the lobby to meet Aurelie, Kouhei, and Edvaldo.\nWe’ve barely spent days together, but this parting is still heavy. We’re saying farewell to what could have been. But the henro-no-michi goes ever forward, so we bury the melancholy with happier chatter and group photos.\nEdvaldo suddenly asks, ‘Does anyone need a hat?’ He won’t need it anymore.\nAurelie says she hates them. But I do! I already miss the one I had to retire two days ago. How bittersweet this is, all the things Edvaldo passes on because of his injury. His oversized sedge hat will complete the Ohenro without him and await his return.\nIt’s a quick walk to the Lawson to get breakfast. Kouhei reveals entirely unexplored corners of the konbini to me with his purchases: a veggie-fruit juice for fibre, CalorieMate as a meal replacement, and more energy drink-meals. Aurelie gets onigiri, but she says it won’t last long. I need a big breakfast comprised of whole foods. After the food, a smoke is part of the ritual the morning ritual for them. For me, it’s the comfort of sipping hot coffee. Together, our calculated nutritional intake balanced with creature comforts. The same, yet individual. We arrive at Temple 78 right when it opens at 7am. We do the rituals in our own ways and wait for each other at the entrance. Kouhei and I fall into a polite group ask before getting our nokyochos. Reflexively, the creaky social gears are turned on.\nMission completed, we turn under the Main Gate, bow in unison back at the temple, and troop off to the next one. Sometimes we go in line, sometimes side by side. Kouhei leads with his cell phone as a guide. I am happy to follow while chatting to Aurelie. There’s so much we’ve learned, so much that we want to process aloud.\nBy the time we hit Temple 79, we were hot, as usual. There is no vending machine, and we’re thirsty. We sit in the shade of the small temple, which is beside a shrine with the same name. Aurelie and I peel off our shoes and wet socks. Smoke break. I watch the ants under the tree and wriggle my free toes.\nThen, onto the next temple. We discover a vending machine down the block, sip our drinks in front, and discard the bottles in the provided bin. Compared to yesterday’s back to back temples, the two-hour walk tediously threads through a suburbia that’s neither picturesque nor an obvious route that allows zoning-out.\nWhen we hit the highway, only the odd cafe and store pop up. Where would a henro stuck here stop? Aurelie and I agree that after all we’ve received, we want to offer shelter to other pilgrims, in Japan or on the Camino de Santiago, Europe’s pilgrimage equivalent to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela in Galicia, Spain. Agnostic foreigners inspired to have a zenkonyado in Shikoku – maybe it’ll even make local headlines; maybe it’ll be a scandal in Kagawa.\nI begin to lag behind as we climb the small hill to the next town. The heat and glare are getting to me, even with Edvaldo’s sedge hat. I’d held out buying a new one because I couldn’t find the rounded-top I wanted, and now I have an even better one. It’s only 10:30 when we arrive at Sanuki’s Kokubun-ji. It has a vast cultivated tree area with boulders that double up for chairs. After finishing our prayer rounds, we lounge on them in the shade, gulping more drinks from the vending machines. The air is stiflingly hot and the cicadas are a crying cascade. More sunscreen for me. Aurelie takes a nap. Kouhei pulls out a cigarette.\nTemple 81 and 82 are on a plateau, which means we need to finish any errands down here first. That means we need to eat lunch and pick up dinner and tomorrow’s breakfast. We’re also in no rush, as Kouhei is waiting for his camping friend to give tips on where to camp on the plateau tonight. I also want to get Wi-Fi to ask my Couchsurfing friends in Tokushima if they can host Edvaldo, who is heading there today to rebook his flight. Aurelie needs to get money at a 7/11.\nFirst, we retrace our steps to lunch at an udon shop on my map. I’m determined to sample more Sanuki udon. The little shop has properly limited menu (the hallmark of quality).\nI choose a table that has outlets underneath. Aurelie blurts, ‘You’re so dependent on your cell phone.’\nReally? That’s what’s been connecting us, guiding us, tracking our distance, and sourcing our lodgings. I remind myself that bluntness is a cultural thing, but I can’t help but feel mildly annoyed by her lack of awareness. Kouhei and I have been using phones to figure out logistics for the upcoming days and require nothing from her. Nojuku on a plateau without conveniences has its challenges, and in our upcoming city of Takamatsu poses other budget-related ones. It’s better to be prepared than grouchy and looking for shelter in cities.\nAnyhow, food arrives! In the summer, Sanuki udon usually has no soup and comes with the dipping sauce added by the customer. The texture is springy, and absorbs enough dashi soy sauce and lemon juice without becoming soggy. The combination of the onions, dashi, deep fried dough bits, seaweed, and bonito flakes make a hearty meal. Our large is a mere 450 JPY.\nAfter finishing, we leave our bags at the shop and visit the konbini for overnight food supplies. I get a donut and iced coffee to top off my meal. This insane heat and our walking metabolisms results in everything consumed going straight out our pores. With food in hand, the other two wait outside while I finish messages with Edvaldo and my friend in Awa City. When it’s done, we retrieve our bags and begin our climb onto the plateau. I’m looking forward to getting my head up where the air’s clearer.\nDespite citing poor health and semi-regular smoking, Kouhei leads the steady climb without stopping. I follow just behind since a steady pace and breathing are key to endurance. Aurelie, who hates hills, can take her time. It’s easier for everyone to go at their own pace and regroup.\nEventually, Kouhei and I stop at a clearing with a breeze. The view here and the cooler air is a welcome change. I drink the last of my water and Kouhei hands me an energy drink with jelly. I’m still full, but I accept and sip the liquid jelly.  ***\nI put my soaked towel and shirt that I wrap on my shoulder straps for padding on the rail to dry. Even a few minutes will dry a few drops-worth. Perhaps the city-life efficiency has bled into my nojuku henro life. I can imagine Kobo Daishi, or at least the Zen masters, laughing at my fixation on earthly matters. After about fifteen minutes, Aurelie arrives. When she’s ready, I get my shirts and we continue up, my mind fixed on the next temple. Once on the plateau, we follow a wide, shaded road that’s a few degrees cooler. The last two kilometers to Temple 81 is a muddy forest trail. Here, Aurelie and Kouhei disappear quickly, unphased by the slippery mud in the gentle descent. It gives me less pressure to keep up. They’ll be waiting at the temple.\nBy the time I arrive, Aurelie gets me a green tea as o-settai, a welcome generosity with the thirst quencher. Sometimes new-found acquaintances can be more generous than long-time friends.\nHowever, it’s 3:30pm, and I want to hit Temple 82 today. I finish the rituals and make plans to meet Aurelie and Kouhei at today’s camp site, which Kouhei’s friend sent photos of. Aurelie and Kouhei can take their time, and I can hit my goal. Something compels me to do this last push. It becomes apparent that the five-kilometre trail is longer than it seems. I use my phone to track my pace, never letting it drop below 6km/hr. The pace is exhilarating. The twists and turns on this path goad me on, as I thrust my staves left and right, leap through puddles, run up muddy banks, and jog where possible. Here, I finally shed the shadow of my terrible sprain in Kochi.\nWhen I emerge back out onto the paved road, I have about 15 minutes to run the final kilometre. There’s another trail shortcut to the temple, but I go along the car route. My breath becomes short and my throat closes as I thump downhill. I’m so close, but I’m not even sure I’m going the right way now. I should just hitch a ride if I want to finish this.\nJust then, a truck comes down the hill. It slows and the driver pokes his head out. ‘Ohenro-san where are you going? Negoro-ji?’\n‘Yes!’\n‘Hop in, I’ll give you a ride! Can you sit at the back?’\nYes! I climb the tire and roll into the pickup truck. Off we sail, down the hill, with a cool breeze that chills my sweaty body. I have 10 minutes left. Tanomimasu. I’m counting on him.\nAfter seven nail-biting minutes, the driver finds the entrance. I hop off and hand him an osamefuda, which they don’t know what to do with. I thank them again and wave as they turn around.\nAs they drive off, I race down and up the stairs of the tree-lined entrance. I arrive at the temple office with all of two minutes to spare. I ask if they’ll let me do the prayers and come back in ten minutes, but the man in the shop says shortly, ‘It’s better if you get the stamp first.’ Fine, if he insists. Then, I leave my bag on the bench and explore the Main Hall, which encloses a square courtyard with its passageways lined with hundreds of Buddha and Bodhisattva statues. Walking through those, I reach the main altar to make my prayers. After finishing here, I return to the Daishi Hall and repeat the ritual. When done, I take a shortcut route out of the complex by climbing through a barbed fence on a slope. As evening descends, I take my time meandering the 2 kilometers back uphill, basking in satisfaction. I’m done. Today happened. When I meet up with Aurelie and Kouhei, they’ve finished setting up their tents on the grass. I get snacks for them from the shop beside the park. It’s a day to celebrate. I walked 30 kilometers, and Aurelie has passed her 25-kilometre record. We have each other, food, and plenty of space. Being stuck on this plateau wasn’t so bad after all, especially when I look up and see the sunset.\n"});index.add({'id':40,'href':'/book/docs/Diary-Entries/day-35/','title':"Day 35 - July 25",'section':"Diary Entries",'content':"=====\nGoshikidai Plateau Henro Hut (五色台遍路小屋) → Furu-Takamatsu (古高松)\nTemples: 83 (Ichinomiya-ji 一宮寺) Weather: Sunny\nTravel Method: Walking\nDistance: 22.7 km\n=====\nAt 5:30am, Kouhei is already done packing his tent and sitting on the bench. Why does he have to be so Japanese (early)?!\nI roll out of Aurelie’s tent inhale the morning dew on the grass. Despite an initially sleepless night, it was one of the best sleeps I’ve had.\nAurelie was right – the grass was more comfortable than the bench I originally chose. It was a valiant effort to set up a lopsided tent, but the higher elevation was chillier than expected, making it difficult to sleep. Then, I heard persistent rummaging noises in the darkness close to my head. Rather than get irritated at me for causing a stir over a cat we eventually found, Aurelie invited me to sleep in her tent, ‘I know what it means to feel afraid.’\nNow, the morning blues. The overnight moisture has seeped into in everything, making me reluctant to pack. Kouhei returns with vending machine iced coffee since he’s ready and we’re barely awake. Aurelie didn’t sleep well, but still packs quickly.\nWhen they’re both standing with their backpacks watching me, I sigh in exasperation. ‘Why does it seem like I’m always the slowest?’\n‘You are,’ Aurelie says briskly. ‘But it’s fine.’\nMy gratitude goes a bit sour. Reminding myself it’s a cultural thing doesn’t take the sting away.\nAs Kouhei and Aurelie march on ahead, I drop behind, trying to take photos of the breathtaking morning sun. It creates a comfortable distance to keep my own company.\nAm I just too sensitive? Or is it justified to expect people to have sensitivity irrespective of culture? Why do words carelessly spoken have so much impact? Did I imagine the judgement in her voice?\nAnyhow, we are walking to Negoro-ji, the temple I ran and hitchhiked to yesterday evening. This time, we follow the henro-no-michi arrows pointing into a forest path. It’s as muddy as yesterday’s, but we come across a surprise: a newly built henro hut.\nWe continue on to the temple, and I wait for them to do their prayers. When we finish, Kouhei presents Aurelie and me a charm each.\nI’m touched, but I can’t help but interpret it. The henro-no-michi is banal and intense. In the vast stretches of nothingness, boredom, and solitude, life is distilled until the most basic things take on significance. We become hypersensitive to our surroundings, constantly overwhelmed by our unfiltered reactions. I think he’s trying to express his gratitude for having company, which we all of us feel. I think his background will compel him to continue to watch over us, to worry, to give. I don’t want his gratitude to become a burden. It’s mutual: we’re supporting each other. When we pass by the new henro hut again, there’s a man filling a tea dispenser on the picnic table. What’s this? He says it’s o-settai provided by a nearby cafe.\nWe help ourselves to the drinks and snacks and check out the new structure. Inside is a jaw-dropping carpeted space with electricity and a loft. Elementary school students have left their drawings for us to take, and the place already has a small collection of osamefuda, figures, notes. We missed out because I skipped on this forest path last night. Thankfully we had yesterday’s breathtaking sunset.\nI continue trailing the whole morning as we descend from the plateau into Takamatsu City, capital of Sanuki udon. Sanuki is the old name for Kagawa Prefecture. Kouhei and Aurelie naturally walk ahead and wait until they see me around a bend. It’s good motivation to keep me at a productive pace.\nThe distance lets me continue meditating. Having Kouhei yesterday already introduced a whole set of experiences, adding Aurelie exponentially multiplies the dynamics. People flood our system with stimuli, and it’s difficult to curb the raw reactions that are harmless in our solitary walks. After learning to dissolve my sense of self on the henro-no-michi, it’s jolted into re-condensing, forming a boundary of me and them.\nI examine the resentment lodged in my mind and find that it has roots. In a bed of silence, the weed had patiently sprouted. I didn’t notice when we were resting more than I normally would. I ignored it when Kouhei and I took the lead in researching nojuku spots and bookings. A promise to meet casually forgotten weeks ago prepared the soil, and a following desperate request finally planted the seed. The recent remarks just brought all of this to light.\nAurelie has done quite well. She’s the youngest in a large family and has always been surrounded by love. She’s walking a foreign country without an understanding of the language or culture. While walking down today, she shares her sobering last days in Shishikui where cultural gaps caused a rift. She was cast back out into the henro-no-michi she had taken refuge from for a month, one that exposes each of our flaws and weaknesses.\nShe glances at Kouhei, who’s out of earshot and says that while he seems calm, he has a heavy heart. ‘I can tell from how much he smokes.’\nWe’ve walked over a mile of shared shoes. Does that give us right to judge?\nOn this path we’ve taken, her weakness is making judgements without an appreciation of cultural context. Mine is responding to judgement with judgement.  We’re at a Lawson at the edge of town having a late breakfast. I use Airbnb to book a place for Kouhei and Aurelie. Neither of them know what it is, but Aurelie was thinking of a 24-hour manga cafe and Kouhei had no plans. Both like the idea of affordable accommodation close to Temple 73 and a tram line. In addition, I want to confirm that Edvaldo is alright. It takes an hour, and the suffocating city heat has returned.\nBy the time I confirm their booking and apologise for the wait, Aurelie concedes, ‘I don’t mind waiting, especially if you’re helping us get a place to stay. With your phone.’\nThe emphasis isn’t lost.\nWith that we continue to Ichinomiya-ji. Perhaps if we’re lucky, today we can get to Temple 84 too.\nIt’s a spiritless walk in the city heat. I don’t know how Kouhei manages in his long sleeves and pants. I’m just glad to have company through this.\nAurelie is in high spirits and keeps ahead while Kouhei accompanies me lagging behind. My leg is beginning to bother me again, but he distracts me by entertaining a variety of topics and teaching me new vocabulary.\nWhen we arrive at the temple, I bolt to the washroom. Something was wrong with that chicken earlier. After a bit, I re-emerge a little paler, but with a restored digestive tract.\nI do my ritual rounds since Aurelie and Kouhei finished earlier and are waiting in the shade. Then, I head to a nearby Lawson to get their AirBnB confirmation, marking an udon shop on the way for lunch. However, my grand plans for Sanuki udon sampling evaporate as another hour evaporates with flat-searching. We follow the owner’s video description at his insistence, which results in Kouhei getting lost, and then them losing me around a corner. Sigh.\nNonetheless, we arrive. Aurelie does laundry, I shower, and Kouhei snacks. All the long delays have added up, and it’s getting late. We cut the sitting short and head out again to hit the last temple for today. Those two have left their bags in the flat, but I keep mine to take to my Couchsurfing place, which I’d found weeks ago. Aurelie offers to take my bag, which I’m grateful for. It’s light for her, but the source of my leg muscle strains. In addition, it’s a daypack and has no shoulder padding. Our walk across the length of Takamatsu is a truly bland, straight, expanse of concrete. When we finally see a konbini, we stop for a late lunch. Due to a misunderstanding, we keep waiting for each other until Kouhei comes to me with alarm and says, ’Can you finish in five minutes? We won’t have enough time.’\nSigh, I’d gotten the ice cream while waiting, but I can eat and walk! Soon after we resume, my limp drags them down far too much. Eventually, Kouhei asks, ‘Are you okay?’\nBefore I can respond, ‘No! Not daijobu!’ Aurelie exclaims with a mix of concern, fatigue, and frustration.\nKouhei hides his startled look when he turns quickly from her to me. He would have felt bad enough without that.\nI tell them to go on ahead as they may still make it at their natural pace, and I’m not staying with them tonight anyway. I’ll find my lodging and we’ll arrange to meet up tomorrow, or two days from now. I have Kouhei’s Line account.\nWith that, I limp to the closest station and wait forty-five minutes for the train. Just being able to sit down, take my shoes off, and charge my dying phone is enough. I just want to sleep. I can’t muster the energy to be sociable when I hear my name echo in waiting area. Aurelie grins and waves. She asks me for the route back and I tell her the tram is at another station. She could transfer here, but the tram is cheaper and more frequent than the train. She finally realises I want to be alone and heads out.\nAfter I arrive, at my host’s century-old house, I don’t have the energy to go back out again for food. It’s close to the station and I followed her instructions to let myself in the unlocked door.\nThe house is as old as the listing promised and still in the middle of refurbishment. The empty to-be-kitchen has a new plastic flooring, one running tap, and painted walls. The old wooden floor planks in the rest of the house are loose, with gaping holes. A few giant spiders have made homes in my room with its old sofa set and futons. The tiled shower area has an ancient wooden tub-bath and a modern draw curtain for privacy. I open all the windows to let out the trapped heat and see a spectacular evening sun hovering over the city. No wonder this single mother bought this place.\nWhen I’m done showering and washing my shirt, I lay out the futon to sleep, even though the sun hasn’t even set. I will survive on the energy drink I had earlier. If I’m really hungry, I can go for midnight udon because Takamatsu is the city for 24-hour, authentic, Sanuki udon. My host even has a colour-coded udon map segmented by business hours. Before I can pass out, my host gets back. She knocks and comes in with her daughter, and shows me the various appliances around the house, scattered where the working outlets are.\nThis wasn’t quite what I’d expected, but then, where any of the other places? I wonder if Kouhei made it in the end. Maybe I should’ve stayed with them. Maybe not. Time will tell.\n"});index.add({'id':41,'href':'/book/docs/Diary-Entries/day-36/','title':"Day 36 - July 26",'section':"Diary Entries",'content':"=====\nFuru-Takamatsu (古高松) → Shido 志度 →Furu-Takamatsu (古高松)\nTemples: 84 (Yashima-ji 屋島寺), 85 (Yakuri-ji 八栗寺), 86 (Shido-ji 志度寺)\nWeather: Sunny\nTravel Method: Walking + Train\nDistance: 12.6 km (+ 3.1 km)\n=====\nSleep, glorious sleep. Last night at around 8pm, I passed out from exhaustion and aches when there was still an evening glow. When I drifted awake at 4am, I still had creaky knees and sore muscles. By 7am, I roll out of my futon with taught legs. But by the time I head out, the cold shower has flushed yesterday’s injuries from my limbs.\nI practically skip from my Couchsurfing house to breakfast at Family Mart (and note a laundromat on the way for later). I settle into a counter seat after purchasing a breakfast nigiri and coffee. I check messages with one hand, granting myself the luxury of connectivity.\nToday, I’ll go up to Temples 84 and 85 which are on two plateaus jutting out into the sea and finish at Temple 86. After, I need to return to Utazu to get my retainer, which I’d left at the onsen, which I’d left at the onsen I’d met Aurelie and Edvaldo in. Thankfully, Kouhei helped me call yesterday to confirm they found it.\nMorning leisure finished, it’s time to hike up to Temple 84 through a recreational trail. As I head up, I join the trickle of senior hiking groups, wiry athletes with dripping foreheads, young families, and city girls chatting the morning away.\nAt a bend, three elderly ladies resting on a bench say hello when I stop for a drink. We fall into a familiar rhythm of discussion: Where are you from? Canada? How far! Are you alone? You do nojuku?! Isn’t that dangerous? A thoughtful exhale. Taihen desu ne? Are you a girl? Of course she is! Oh, I thought you were a boy! They stare at each other in mutual shock before letting out peels of laughter.\nIt’s a conversation that flows well for both short exchanges and long conversations. Since we’re going in opposite directions, I leave them to enjoy the view and each other’s company saying, ‘O daiji ni.‘ They respond with the customary ‘O kyotsuketekudasai.’\nTemple 84 is spread across the expanse of Yashima, the site of the second last major battle in the Genpei War between the Genji (Minamoto) and Heike (Taira) clans. The Minamoto Clan’s victory ushered in the beginning of ‘feudal Japan’ and the country’s first shogunate. Minamoto no Yoritomo, Japan’s first Shogun, is commonly thought to have killed his suave and talented half brother, Minamoto no Yoshitsune, Japan’s most famous tragic hero and the subject of countless tales on every medium. The historical associations sustains this temple even in the summer heat. History buffs and travellers feed off the suggestive ruins in one area, shelter in a paid museum, imagine the armies from the lookouts, and pluck lines of poetry off the blossoms in the garden.\nMost will pause at Yashima-ji as they move through the compound. What strikes me is the temple’s red paint and peculiar decoration in the beams supporting the eaves; they seem very Chinese, and I learn from the information plaque that the temple does have Chinese associations. Sitting right beside is a giant tanuki and Japanese Shinto torii, a typical co-existence between the two religions for centuries.\nBut today I am a pilgrim and not a history buff. I need to go. Also, I want to eat as much Sanuki udon as possible while in Takamatsu. The henro-no-michi from Yashima-ji to Temple 85 is cuts straight down the side of the plateau and passes a famous restaurant.\nBy the end of the long, slightly overgrown path and stairs, my knees are shaking. I descend into quaint suburbia with its residential harbour and yachts. A promenade appears by the waterway. City life has such inviting familiarity.\nI reach a bridge that crosses over the water to the other plateau and immediately find a Marunaka supermarket. Henro provision (aka food!) shopping is in order. After wandering through the isles, I sit down outside on a bench in the shade, gulping greedily until my throat hurts. I finally stop snacking when my stomach does too. I’m still looking for my listed udon shop on the way.\nAfter checking out every intersection for what I expected to be a hole-in-the-wall noodle joint, I see a prominent sign beside the road. All the cars in town seem to be end up in the parking lot of Yamadaya. It is traditional stand-alone building with an enclosed entrance and garden. Oh dear, is this going to be super expensive?\nWhen I slide open the entrance, I can hear the dishes and hissing of the kitchen. Once they have a seat for me, I lock my shoes in a drawer and follow a waiter to the tatami eating area. I get a spot with a corner garden view.\nIt turns out that their base plain udon is a reasonable 350 Yen. But today, I’ll treat myself with a cold udon set with a raw egg. When it comes, I slurp in the chilled noodles, accented with a special dashi soy sauce, deep fried dough bits, sesame seeds, lemon, chilled grated daikon, and spring onions. Sanuki udon is known for its chewiness and this hit the spot perfectly.\nEven though the restaurant is mostly full, the tables are filled and cleared at a gentle pace. The families, couples, tourists, sit back after they’re done, chatting and laughing. There may be a wait, but no-one is pressured to leave.\nI lean back on my arms. Kimochiiiiii. This type of comfort is surreal.  Temple 85, Yakuri-ji, is an easy climb. There’s no real need for the cable car, but Japan seems to like them. The temple seems like a shy twin to Yashima-ji and is nestled under the cliff face under the peaks. The Main Hall has exquisite statues of protective komainu, which are more often found in Shinto Shrines. They remind me of Chinese protective lions, which Kukai might have seen when he went to China after planting eight chestnut trees here (giving the temple its name).\nAfter doing my rounds, I pick up the nokyocho for a friend and strike up conversation with the man at the office who has just retired from his job and started working here. His son studied in Canada. We could go on, but another pilgrim is waiting to get his nokyocho.\nI follow the leafy single-lane road back down to town. Cement downhills are really hard on the knees and I feel my tendons straining to keep the weight. Fortunately, I have two staves to help. It’s still early afternoon, but I’m ready to wrap up the day soon.\nYesterday drifts into mind — snippet observations and feelings I’m unsettled by. I think about Aurelie often. She’s the only other toshi-uchi (all-in-one-go) nojuku henro I know, discounting her month break in Shishikui. Even Kouhei returned to Kyoto for a week after each prefecture. Also, both of us are foreign women. Even with my basic Japanese and Chinese it’s been a challenge. Hers must be far worse. And yet…\nBy now, I’m out of the woods and enter a town in afternoon shut-down. The heat creates a smothering desolation, an invisible blanket where snow would be for winter.\nThat’s it. I’m taking the tram to Shido-ji. I’ve walked enough.\n Shido-ji feels like a garden complex with a maze of pathways and signs to the Main Hall, Daishi Hall, and stamp office. If I wasn’t in a rush to make the tram back to the city centre, I’d just sit and enjoy the overgrown garden. Unfortunately I don’t have time, so I just light my incense, which I’m running out of. I guess this is the home stretch.\nWith Shido-ji done, I walk back to the tram stop close by. When I get to the entrance, Kouhei and Aurelie are sitting on the benches against the wall.\nWhat are they doing here? I’d seen them marching briskly past me down the street earlier. They didn’t hear me call from the intersection. I thought they were rushing to the next temple.\nAurelie tells me, ‘We’re going back to get our bags. I saw a good camping spot at the michi-no-eki by the sea. How was your place?’\n‘There’s no laundry!’ My henro preoccupations spout out unfiltered.\nThe corners of her lips curl up. ‘Sometimes you can never tell with those types of places.’\nAbout 5 minutes before the tram arrives, I head outside to the platform. I’d rather wait in the sun than add this to my list of missed trains or frantic running episodes.\n‘We still have time. We can see it when it arrives,’ Aurelie says.\nIt’s true. The tracks stop right at the doorway. She can wait if she wants.\nWhen the it arrives, I put my hat in the bag compartment above and sit down. Soon, we’re cruising behind the row of houses in front of the deep blue sea.\nI tell them I need to take the train back to Utazu to get my retainer. If I didn’t, I’d go for udon. Did they see the udon shop up to Temple 85? Nope, they bought stuff at the supermarket, like I had.\nThere are options though! I show Aurelie the locations on my phone. The places are in Japanese, so I suggest marking them on our henro map, but she says, ‘Never mind. It’s too complicated.’\n‘Yamada-ya is on our guide, though.’ I open our book and point out the English mark. Good food feeds the soul, too. ‘You can go here for dinner on your way to the michi-no-eki.’\nShe doesn’t seem very interested, so I drop it.\nShall we meet tomorrow and finish together? Kouhei gives his casual okay. Aurelie does, too. I suggest the Henro Cultural Centre, since we can get our certificates too.\nKouhei asks me where I’ll stay tonight. The same place as last night. He pauses. We speak in Japanese because English is a struggle for him. He admits being worried about Aurelie. That’s been obvious in the way he usually searches her face for reactions. I reassure him by saying that she used to travel alone. If he needs to do something, he can say so.\nThen, he asks me to tell Aurelie that he won’t go with her to the michi-no-eki tonight. Perhaps I should have asked why, but I didn’t. We all have our reasons. I just relay the message to her.\nAfter a moment, she says, ‘I think want to walk alone tomorrow.’\nPerhaps she wanted me to ask why, but I don’t. She has her reasons. Something unravels. We’ve only spent two days together. Maybe it took being together to see ourselves and how unequipped we are still to take care of ourselves, let alone others.\nBy late evening, I’m walking 30 minutes with my clothes to the laundromat.\nEarlier, I finished the return train trip to Utazu to retrieve my retainer. Then, arriving back in Takamatsu station, I retrieved my sedge hat, which I had forgotten in my rush out the train. Silly and lucky on two counts. I’m grateful. Hopefully I haven’t used up my luck quota yet.\nDoubling back means sacrificing my Sanuki udon dinner. There’s nothing close to the laundromat, so I go back to this morning’s Family Mart and venture to try an instant ochazuke, rice with a tea broth. I inhale it to return to the laundromat and toss everything in the dryer. It’s expensive, but at least it’s clean laundry!\nI hug my clothes all the way back home and prepare to sleep.\nUnfortunately, my host returns and asks for help on some translations. She’s done an excellent job. It’s incredible that her English is self-taught. I wish I had time to chat, but I’m about to pass out and I need to get up at 4am tomorrow. I hold out for an hour, but I can only look over the rest of her stuff in a week or two.\nBefore they return to their side of the house, I give her daughter the small Jizo figure I’d received outside Temple 77. It has a serene smile much like her innocent one when she lets down her scowl.\nThat brings me to the end of my stay in Takamatsu. Tomorrow, I will finish Temple 88 and Kagawa. Then, I’ll need to finish Temples 4-8, 11-17, and then return to Temple 10 to complete my kechigan, to close the circle. That’s a headache. But one that can wait for tomorrow.\n"});index.add({'id':42,'href':'/book/docs/Diary-Entries/day-37/','title':"Day 37 - July 27",'section':"Diary Entries",'content':"=====\nFuru-Takamatsu (古高松) → Zoda Station (造田駅) → Tokushima Otsuru Ryokan (徳島市大鶴旅館)\nTemples: 87 Nagao-ji (長尾寺), 88 Ōkubo-ji (大窪寺)\nWeather: Sunny → Cloudy → Rain → Cloudy\nTravel Method: Train + Walking + Bus to Tokushima\nDistance: 17.6 (+ 5.2) km\n=====\n5:57am. I see the pricing board in the train above the exit where the conductor takes the fare. Ehime and Kochi don’t have it. It’s on Tokushima trains. Wait, this train is going to Tokushima. So am I, except I’ll get off early and walk some 50 km. Significance is a function of self-inflicted hardship, indeed. I’ve been at this for over a month, am about to finish, and the absurdity of denying myself a ride still amuses me.\nI’m on the first train heading close to Temple 87, Nagao-ji, on a funky cocktail mix of early-morning adrenaline, lacking sleep, and a cheese-with-bread breakfast. The ride’s too short for dozing, so I watch the picture-book towns between the hills pass to the steady train rattle.\nI’m still thinking about how to make it to Tokushima tonight. It’s a long walk, and I need to conserve energy for a few more days of walking. After Temple 88, I need to finish Temple 4-8, then 11-17 in Tokushima Prefecture because I started piecemeal and out of order. Walking 50km and camping in the mountains today isn’t smart if I need to climb another mountain, the notorious Temple 12, tomorrow. Taking transit to get back to Tokushima City the roundabout way after finishing Temple 88 will take longer than walking.\nI’ve been stewing on solutions for a few days, but I’ll just have to trust things will work out once I get to the top of the mountain today. They usually do.\n Zoda Station is a short walk to Temple 87 and I arrive just after it opens. There’s already someone there.\nKouhei! How on earth did he reach here already?\nHe slept close by in front of a konbini and barely got 4 hours with the traffic. Yesterday evening, after returning to Takamatsu on the tram with Aurelie and me, he’d picked up his bags and started walking again until he arrived in the area around 10pm. Now, it’s clear why he had told Aurelie he wouldn’t be doing nojuku with her last night: he needed to walk, but didn’t think she’d be up for his plan, and probably didn’t have the energy to use translators to explain.\nLast night, we’d also agreed to meet at the Henro Cultural Centre at around 10am today. Does he still want to walk there together? Or perhaps he’d want to walk alone. Ends are important. Finishing them meaningfully is more important.\nHe’s fine with waiting.\nSure? I need coffee down the street after this.\nSure.\nI light my incense. This is another one of those temples in the middle of an old town that once had a lively courtyard with chattering parents and playing kids. Nonetheless, I enjoy the morning tranquillity, when I add my incense to Kouhei’s to the urn. I place my hands together and whisper prayers to my friends. One of them has been on my mind a while, and I’ve procrastinated until now, never feeling it was the right moment, but I’m running out of temples.\nWhen I finish, my hands stay glued together a minute longer as something peels away, a weight that I didn’t know was there until I felt it lift.\nMaybe one day, I’ll understand why the act of putting your hands together and whispering a wish into thin air can affect our physiology so much. For now, I’ll just get the nokyocho and get going with Kouhei.\n‘You must really like coffee. Do you drink it every morning?’ Kouhei asks.\nNo, actually, I’ve not been drinking it much because there aren’t washrooms. Still, I need to treat myself once in a while. This is a morning toast to my first-last day.\nWhen I finish, we follow the last kilometres of the henro-no-michi out of the town.\nThe Henro Cultural Centre is beside a lake on the slopes undulating up to Okubo-ji. Inside, there’s a free museum with historical pieces of the pilgrimage. There’s neatly arranged clothing, osamefuda, photos, and nokyochos from over a hundred years ago. How did these people do it then? Aruki henro may be a small and shrinking subset of people, but we continue to trickle through. We’re without drivers and horses, as the wealthy in days gone by would have come, but clean konbini flush toilets and cell phones more than make up.\nWe wait for the office to give us the certificate of completion, and we leave our osamefuda, in boxes for each of the prefectures. There is even a box for foreign henro. I pull out the slips and flip through. What brought these people here? What fragments of their stories can I glean from these few characters with their address, their handwriting, their dates? Just holding the stack makes me feel warm.\nWe help ourselves to the tea and the snacks in the centre, waiting until 11am for Aurelie in case she decided to come.\nThe last eight kilometres. They begin gently on the road meandering up the lush, green hills. There’s an odd building here and there. The sun’s disappeared behind the clouds. We’re setting a good pace, but we need to beat the rain.\nFinally, we arrive at the trailhead with a stream. Guarding the entrance to Okubo-ji is Mt. Nyotai, almost as high as Unpen-ji at over 700 metres, which henro must scale up and go right back down. It’s the down I’m dreading. I take my time refilling my water in the stream. We will need this.\nKouhei takes off his long-sleeve for the first time. We pick up our bags and head into the forest one last time. Let’s do this.\nDespite Unpen-ji’s blocked wreckage and Yokomine-ji’s floods, Okubo-ji claims the most dangerous trail segments, in my opinion. It is the only trail where I use my hands to climb up crags of rock and has a ledge with a sheer slope. Thankfully, it started raining at the end of the most slippery and precipitous part. If Aurelie came, I hope she is ahead of us.\nWith the rain come the clouds that swallow the mountain. The day before, I’d seen another henro’s photos of the view of the valley from near the top. Now at that spot, I look into a white abyss. The silence up here rumbles. The droplets poke playfully at the leaves of the small trees.\nJust before the final descent, I ask Kouhei to take a picture. He never takes photos, and this is his evidence that he took the more challenging route to his kechigan, completion of his pilgrimage. He stands obligingly for a few, including the ‘V’ for victory. My favourite, though, is the one with the thumb up, with a determined, puckered lips. Yosh! We’re almost there.\nIn the end, we ascended 300 metres from the trailhead only to come down just as many metres. My Strava app tells me so. The steps are set, but punishing on my terrible knees. I hold my breath watching every step so that I don’t roll on my ankles. Kouhei sailed down and stopped every few minutes to make sure I was still around. How does he do it?\nWe arrive at Okubo-ji at 1pm. By now, I’ve accepted the wisdom in our elders, who chose the site on the remote side of the mountain. Get off your high horses. What goes up, must come down. Why would a monk need a lofty view? Or perhaps they just slashed through the most direct route rather than circumventing the peak the way the cars do now. Perhaps it was just coincidence.\nOkubo-ji is like every other temple, unique. We descend via its back gate to its modest, but nonetheless intricate, Main Hall with the regal mountain slope for a backdrop. The Daishi Hall is in another section of the grounds, a newer, larger section with vine-covered trellises, and a regal tri-arch gate. This is the temple where thousands of henro staves are collected to be burned.\nI light my incense, just grateful I made it here in one piece, injury free. Just like Temple 38 at Cape Ashizuri, I’m washed with relief and gratitude. Unlike that time, I’m beyond exhaustion. Even though I have Temples 4-17 to go, it feels like the hardest parts are over.\nWith our nokyochos in hand, we take a quick break on one of the benches. Kouhei is chewing on a stick of CalorieMate, which comes in the square yellow-orange boxes that pop up in every konbini.\nWhat does it taste like? I thought they were for weight loss. I didn’t realise they were actual meals!\n‘Try it. Dozo.’ He hands me a fruit flavoured one.\nI break open the package, pull one out and bite. It’s dry, like a cookie, but not buttery. The flavour is mild and conservative, a bit sweet with the light flavouring, but also savoury and starchy. It’s actually perfect. Why hadn’t I discovered this before?! The other stick is gone in a minute.\nBut after that, we need to head out to make the 13:30 bus back to the city. I hope Aurelie finishes today too, wherever she is.\nBy 4pm, we are back in Tokushima and checked into Otsuru Ryokan. When Kouhei decided to take the bus back rather than spend another day walking from Temple 88 to Temple 1, as some aruki henro do, I knew my solution had presented itself. He was meeting a friend, which turned out to be the elderly proprietress, also a henro herself, and it was no trouble to take an extra room during low season.\nAfter we drop our bags off in the rooms, I immediately head out to celebrate. Kagawa Prefecture is finished and in great company. I have a comfortable place tonight rather than somewhere in the mountains with mosquitos. That is reason enough for late afternoon dessert.\nI find a bakery-cafe just a block away and indulge in a strawberry shortcake with tea. Sitting down at the back, with a view of the coffee bar and the street, I check the time. Twelve hours ago, I was just waking up in the darkness of a 100-year-old house. Now, I’m enjoying piano jazz, more like my undergraduate hipster self lounging away an afternoon.\nMy two previous memories of Tokushima are characterless. This time, it feels warm and familiar. It feels like I am rediscovering it after a year, even though it’s been a month month.\nI realise we forgot to take a picture at Okubo-Ji and smile at nothing in particular. We accomplished it. Task completed. Relief. Satisfaction. Next.\nAfter sitting on this soft chair for eternity, inhaling the fragrance of the strawberries in the cream, I pay and leave. It’s only 5:30pm.\nI get pre-made dishes from a supermarket and sit by the river to enjoy the sunset. There’s a breeze. The rows of neon lights are getting more distinct. The street lamps along the bridge become glowing orbs against the magenta and cobalt sky.\nAs I finish the veggies, enjoying the crunchy textures flavoured with sesame oil, feeling the satisfaction of rice in my tummy, I think about tomorrow. Tomorrow, I begin my real last days.\nI hadn’t liked Tokushima when I first arrived. Tokushima is the Prefecture of Spiritual Awakening, where henro usually begin their journey. I’d started in bits and pieces, doing Temple 10 and 9, 1 to 3, then skipping to Temple 18. Haphazard, whimsical, ill-planned, complicated, so it seemed to me at the time. Now, staring over the waterway to the shops on the other side, it no longer feels that way. It had turned out to be an opportunity to come back with see with a clearer sense of appreciation.\nEven though this seems culturally out of context, one of the few poems I know keeps looping:\n Such wilt thou be to me, who must,\nLike th’ other foot, obliquely run;\nThy firmness makes my circle just,\nAnd makes me end where I begun.\n– John Donne, “A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning”\n I don’t know who I’d say it to. I don’t know what the anchor is. I don’t know what there is to love. Maybe I’ll find out if I return to the place that I’d begun.\n"});index.add({'id':43,'href':'/book/docs/Diary-Entries/day-38/','title':"Day 38 - July 28",'section':"Diary Entries",'content':"=====\nTokushima Otsuru Ryokan (徳島市大鶴旅館) → Kamojima Town Kamo-no-Yu Onsen Henro Hut (鴨島町鴨の湯遍路小屋) Temples: 4 Dainichi-ji (大日寺), 5 Jizō-ji (地蔵寺), 6 Anraku-ji (安楽寺), 7 Jūraku-ji (十楽寺), 8 Kumadani-ji (熊谷寺), 9 Hōrin-ji (法輪寺), 11 Fujii-dera (藤井寺) Weather: Cloudy → Sunny Travel Method: Walking (from Itano Station) Distance: 35 km\n=====\nToday is my longest walking day. I get up around 5:30am and make two bananas my breakfast. I pack two sets of things: the stuff in my backpack for another two days and the rest to leave at the ryokan for pickup.\nThe obaa-san who runs it has packed lunch onigiri for Kouhei and me. We’re heading on the same train and he will get off at Temple 1 to complete his kechigan while I get off at Itano Station to continue walking from Temples 4 to 11.\nIt’s the first time the view outside the train is familiar. Kouhei is beside me looking down at nothing in particular. He apologises for not coming to dinner last night because he’d passed out of exhaustion. I wave it off, glad he caught sleep after his all-nighter before we climbed to Okubo-ji, Temple 88, together yesterday. Instead, I ask if he can help with one last favour: look up an affordably henro ryokan in Kamojima, close to Temple 11, and message me with details.\nThis is probably the last time I’ll see him. I won’t remember the details of his dark, round face behind bookish glasses. I’ll remember the way he smokes, his energy drinks, his gait, his habit of changing into a presentable shirt at the end of the day, his halting speech. He’s clean shaven this morning, cleaned up to go home to Kyoto this afternoon.\nDon’t judge a man until you’ve walked a mile in his shoes. It is almost literally true. You really do feel the same things. We’ve gone under the same sun, walked the same roads, accepted urbanite discomforts. The road highlights our shared humanity as much as it does our human differences. No-one’s shoes will fit as snug as your own. You can’t walk in someone else’s shoes. But you can share a mile with them. After a few hundred, judgement is discarded somewhere along the way with all the other extra baggage.\nHe steps off, and after an initial wave, marches past. I’m glad we met. I hope he’s glad too.\nI’m at Dainichi-ji bright and early, when the nuns are sweeping the garden entrance and the monk is preparing the grounds. After lighting my incense and dedicating my prayers, I wait until the monk is ready to write my nokyocho.\nAfter that, it’s a half hour walk back out of the valley to Jizo-ji via the Go-hyaku-rakan back entrance. Here, I have my first onigiri, a soft-ball-sized filled riceball, lightly pan-toasted, and wrapped neatly in pink wrapping paper. I do it as an excuse to stay in the complex under a ginko tree.\nGinko trees are living fossils, meaning they are the only species left of their kind. They are widely cultivated for medicinal and culinary uses, and the fruit is known in Chinese as baiguo (白果) and Japanese as ginan / ginko (銀杏). They are highly resistant to disease and insects, have aerial routes and sprouts, and were the only living things that survived the Hiroshima atomic bomb within a 1-2km radius. Those trees healed and are alive today.\nAfter that, I go into a konbini to stock up on snacks and drinks, picking up boxes of CalorieMate sticks that Kouhei introduced me to.\nBut I don’t need a long break like I used to and happily continue on after I’m done resting. There’s a skip in my walk. I realise I’m grinning — cheek muscles I haven’t used in a while it seems.\nThe temples in the Awa Plain feel so close and I’m always a bit surprised when I arrive. I have speed, but no haste. The few days of training with Kouhei and Aurelie have been effective. My Strava app tells me my average pace is 11mins/km, which means I’m comfortably keeping 5.5km/hr. When I walked Temples 1 to 3 in late June, I had ambled along for three hours to cover 8km and was exhausted by the end. That day, I had half a backpack, like today, and twirled my new staff, bored by the quiet towns and thin, but steady, traffic.\nMy staff is a bit shorter now, its base worn and sanded, its bands dark. When I first got it, it felt like another commercial stick in a stock of pilgrimage paraphanalia at Temple 1. I wanted something more personal at the time. Now, it has a personalised shine in the middle, oiled by the gallons of sweat I’ve wiped on it.\nThe weather is fine today, cloudy with breezes. I’m reminded that Tokushima is the prefecture of backyards and bamboo groves. The henro-no-michi here constantly takes you through fields, past homes, through back paths. It is also extremely well marked with red stickers and arrows — a perfect ambassador for the thousands of pilgrims that pass by.\nI arrive at Anraku-ji in no time. It’s a funny place with a side garden, a new gate, a new community building, and some distinct statues. I wonder who decided the style of statue on the fountain. This temple is supposed to have a tsuyado in the bell tower, which would have been a cool nojuku place, but I won’t be stopping here today.\nAfter finishing my rounds, I move on to Juraku-ji just fifteen minutes walk away. It has a large fortress-like gate, an impressive temple lodging for paying guests and a decorative fountain. It also has an eatery in the parking lot, but I happily munch on my remaining two homemade onigiri.\nNext is Kumadani-ji. I wonder if there really used to be bears here, as the name suggests. I have a lot of mental space to wonder now. The Awa Plain is familiar to me, and I will finish the pilgrimage in the next few days. My mind is relaxed just by the familiarity of the hills.\nAnyhow, it’s an unusual 200 metre walk from the main gate to the temple. The walkway to the Main Hall has chanting from hidden speakers, another unusual feature. There’s a final climb up steep stairs to the Main Hall, and then again to the Daishi Hall. Two ojii-san sink on the bench beside me after they arrive, heaving, but happy with each other’s company.\nSeeing them reminds me of another wiry man with whiskers of white hair who cycled daily to the cafe by the beach that I once worked at. One day, during a lull in the breakfast rush, I finally asked him what his route was when I brought his coffee. He gave me a location on a mountain, which he’ll be returning to right after.\nI asked him why he came so far for coffee.\nHe said, ‘So that I can cycle back up.’\nHow long did it take him?\n’Forty-five minutes.’\nBack then, it took me the same time to do half the climb and half the distance. But it was reassuring to know that it was physically possible when I had tippled my age.\nWalking to the next temple, Horin-ji, Temple 9, is another trip down memory lane. This was the second temple I visited after I impulsively set off on my farm host’s bike over a month ago. At the time, I just really wanted to ride, and Temples 9 and 10 happened to be the right distance. I thought I was killing two birds with one stone, getting a head start on the pilgrimage. In the end, I’ve had to retrace my steps anyway.\nStaring at the solemn Kobo Daishi in front of the Main Hall with flowers at his feet, it feels like he’s asking ‘What have you learned?’  The Awa Plain is ten kilometres across. Are you happy now? I ask myself. I’d wondered about it since the day I arrived in late June. Now, I’ve physically walked across it during the hottest hours. The Yoshino River, which flows from Mount Ishizuchi to Tokushima, is a sliver on Google Maps, but so bloody wide. Damn you river that just happens to feed everyone in this massive valley.\nAfter I cross the bridge, it’s still a walk into the heart of Kamojima town on the other side. Slowly, slowly, the shops grow more dense on the street. There’s even two-story signs! It also has canals. That’s cute.\nThe Lawson was supposed to be close, but it’s really not. When I get in, I message Kouhei to see if he’s spoken to the ryokan, which offers henro accommodation at 1000 Yen. He’s arrived back in Kyoto and helped me research the Japanese description which reads: Akatsuki-An. Close to East Kamojima Fire Station (which I find out later is inaccurate).\nThe treasure hunt is on. He’s reached the owner, but can’t figure out where it is. Google Maps is showing the wrong spot for me. Sigh. I tell him I’ll go to Fujii-dera, Temple 11, first and check messages again later.\nAnother three hours later, I’m back at the same Lawson and flustered. After finishing Fujii-dera, I walked to Kamo-no-Yu, which is an onsen with a henro hut on the nojuku henro list. If it weren’t for the promise of a proper ryokan, the henro hut with an onsen beside seems grand.\nI went in search of this Akatsuki-An, which didn’t pick up my calls. I asked the Kamojima Fire Station that Google Maps was directing me to, and they told me the listing is based on the old fire station location, which they point out to me on the map, just behind the Lawson that I was messaging from. Armed with the next clue, I march full circle.\nBut half an hour later, no luck, and it’s getting dark, and I’m hungry. I wandered the small residential alleys and asked the locals, but no-one could help. Frustrated, I message Kouhei and tell him I’ve been going in circles. It’s the first time I’ve whined, and I’m ashamed of it right after I hit send. This isn’t how you treat someone who’s gone out of his way to help you right after arriving home.\nSigh. I’ll make up, somehow. First, I need dinner.\nNever shop for dinner on an empty stomach. I buy a full bag of bread sticks, CalorieMate boxes, milk, veggie juice, and salad. Half-way through chugging my milk, I had to stop to hold my food down.\nBreath in. Breath out. Check messages on Wi-Fi. All will be well.\nWhen my stomach has finished its tantrum, I troop back towards Kamo-no-Yu. It’s so good, I don’t feel like I’ve missed out on the elusive ryokan.\nThe onsen is 360 Yen entry, and I sit outdoors watching the sky go from violet to cobalt around the beaming moon. The henro hut has free laundry and a coin dryer. The girl’s hut needs a replacement bulb, so they give me the guy’s hut since I’m the only one today. It even has an outlet for my phone, a small counter with paper for writing diary entries, and hangers. I lay down, savouring the peace and privacy.\nI’ve walked thirty-five kilometres today, an extra five just looping around town. Unwittingly, I made a new record.\n"});index.add({'id':44,'href':'/book/docs/Diary-Entries/day-39/','title':"Day 39 - July 29",'section':"Diary Entries",'content':"=====\nKamojima Town Kamo-no-Yu Onsen Henro Hut (鴨島町鴨の湯遍路小屋) → Tokushima Otsuru Ryokan (徳島市大鶴旅館)\nTemples: 12 Shōsan-ji (焼山寺), 13 Dainichi-ji (大日寺), 14 Jōraku-ji (常楽寺), 15 Awa Kokubun-ji (阿波国分寺), 16 Kannon-ji (観音寺), 17 Ido-ji (井戸寺)\nWeather: Sunny \u0026amp; Cloudy\nTravel Method: Walking (+ Car + Train return to Tokushima)\nDistance: 25.7 (+ 25.9) km\n=====\n1305. 225. 15.7. 14:19. 25.7.\nSigh. Breathe. Smile. Sit. Close eyes.\nThose are the last numbers of my pilgrimage. It is a 1305 metre elevation gain, 225 minutes of moving time, over 15.7km, at a pace of 14:19mins/km from my henro hut to Shōsan-ji. My total walk on my last day is 25.7km when I add Temples 13 to 17, my 88th and final temple.\nWhere there are no words, there is solace in numbers. The thousand interpretations can all be true.  My alarm goes off in twilight. I push off my tent-blanket and get up, awake but not alert yet. I slide my way out of the hut and pile my breakfast onto the picnic table just outside. The air is saturated with cool humidity, ruffled by a light breeze.\nI munch on CalorieMate sticks and onigiri, sipping a veggie smoothie and water as I watch the sun climb the flat hills. I smell damp morning grass – a rare scent in these parts.\nI retrace my steps to Fujii-dera, Temple 11. The route to Shosan-ji, Temple 12, starts here and goes straight through three mountains. It’s 6:30am and the early hikers and pilgrims have already begun.\nThe entrance into the woods is a ubiquitous collection of signs, altars and stones. Once upon a time, this was probably what most of the paths between the temples looked like, even the ones in the valleys that are now neatly paved over with gridded towns.\nAlright, here we go.\nI set a pace that tempts me to gasp for breath. Focus on breathing. Breathe through the nose. I keep my head down, watchful for anything on the trail that I can roll my ankle on. The shadow of injury lingers. Focus.\nThe path is nothing like I’d expected. I’d imagined an amalgamation of all the mountain temples: 20, 21, 27, 45, 60, 66, 81, 82, 88. Surely the hardest temple must match them. My memory weaves together the steep inclines, endless paths under dark canopies, mosquito havens, sticky mud, treacherous climbs, and ample weeds.\nInstead, the dirt here is soft padding for the feet, and the natural undulation spreads the work throughout the muscles that flat concrete doesn’t do. The roots of trees make natural stairs. The young evergreens sprinkle morning sunlight through their branches. The large stone slabs to push off during the climbs are cool to the touch.\nThe first climb runs along a hill still facing the Awa Valley and after 200 metres it opens up with a view and a natural breeze before turning into the mountains.\nI can feel my breakfast. I ate too much to be walking so fast. A hornet keeps me at a brisk pace for the first few kilometres until I see a spring. There are only two or three spots to refill along the way, so I fill my bottle and remind myself to look around, enough to commit these places to memory.\nI’m racing, against no-one in particular, just the average five hour estimate. What I lack in physical talent, I try to make up for with sheer will. This trail brings back an instilled mindset: seeking pain for gain. You’re dying? Good, you’ve warmed up. Thanks, Coach.\nWhen I first started, I passed a man at the trailhead, shortly followed by two ojii-san chatting at a bench. There’s another ojii-san henro that started again when I stopped at Chodo-An, the first checkpoint with a washroom; when we reached a clearing, I pass him after a brief chat. There’s also a couple that were returning from their morning hike – so early! Compared to my previous trails, this one is lively. The other henro…how’re they finding this? What are they thinking?\nI’m not. This is too fun for thinking.\nThe route to Shosan-ji is only 12.9km, but since most henro encounter it on their second or third day of walking, it looms as the test in later memory. Mountain roads are unpredictable, and most people are reduced to 3km/hr because of the uphill or downhill. In addition to being isolated, this route has three peaks to climb. There are three unattended Buddhist temples that serve as checkpoints: Chodo-An, Ryusui-An, and Jyoren-An.\nMy first real stop is at Ryusui-An, which has a bamboo water fountain and a bench. It has a series of small buildings, some old, some newer, that are maintained just enough to survive nature’s reclamation. It’s a shady spot on a slope. I retie my shoelaces and, restless, set out again.\nOne checkpoint left.  What is this place? Two stone pillars rise from the ground flanking stone steps masked under a blanket of leaves covering the small slope. Branches reach and dangle around. At the top is Kobo Daishi himself underneath a gigantic tree. From the bottom of the stairs, his silhouette seems poised to descend. The tree behind him looks like it’s still bursting out of the ground.\nThis is Joren-An, the last checkpoint. The pools of sunlight only make the shade darker. The hydrangeas are wild orphans left behind by the people who once occupied the small, wooden buildings to the side. The bushes have extended in all unfettered directions. My spine tingles. I feel a current. Despite the occasional rustle of leaves, there is a resounding silence.\nAfter lingering a while, a hornet urges me along.\nThe last stretch from Joren-An to Shosan-ji is a steep descent into a valley before climbing the final mountain. It’s down, down, down, and killer on the knees. I rely on both my staves and my upper body to take the weight.\nIn the valley, it passes a hamlet and crosses a small road. At the base, I follow a path through garden grasses. I pass an elderly lady cutting the tall weeds on the pathway wall.\nDon’t stop, don’t stop, don’t lose momentum. Those words carry me up, up, UP! Yosh! I can’t stop to talk to the lean henro in the corner of my eye as I turn up the zig-zag route. I look up from the ground briefly to say hello and see him seated, mouth open, shoulders and chest heaving, wiping his soaked forehead with his limp arm. He has such sculpted calves. His eyes widen, but I’ve already turned again. ‘Are you a guy? A girl?!’ He shouts after me.\n‘Yes,’ I exhale with another step. Hopefully, he heard.\nTime doesn’t exist in ‘the zone’. At the right pace, balancing the muscle fatigue, the concentrated breath, the brow-wiping, you can go on forever. Next, next, next. Fast, but not rushed. Steady, but not slow.\nThen, I’m at a clearing with a wide gravel path. I follow it and arrive at the paved road from the parking lot to Shōsan-ji.\nThe guest rest area of Shōsan-ji is empty. Still, there are visitors: two newlyweds, two Chinese, two staff-holding henro. It’s a quick set of rituals, buying the nokyocho, and then I sit with the view, enjoying an iced coffee and CalorieMate.\nIt is the temple of the burning mountain because, according to legend, a large serpent set fire here. Kukai had visited to carry out ascetic training, and chanted the Shingon Sutras to confine the dragon into a cave that is on the way to the Okunoin, the Inner Sanctuary.\nI’ll visit the dragon another day. I’m thinking about the walk down to the bus stop. I’m hoping another arum henro arrives so I have company walking down. The henro grapevine says that Shōsan-ji has someone lurking in the woods on the way to Temple 13 who approaches women walking alone and steals from nojuku henro at night.\nBut no-one comes, and the stamp office tells me that it’s close to a two hour walk down. It’s just past 11:00 and another tight call. Should I try another focused charging session?\nThat’s when I see a middle-aged couple stroll in, observing the architecture, checking the view, looking up the towering trees spaced out as natural pillars. The woman has an enthusiastic smile, and the man a patient, if aloof, demeanour. Would they mind if a random, scruffy fellow asked for a ride?\nI pick up the courage ask the happy lady.\nShe defers to her husband who says, ’What? Oh, a ride. Sure, not a problem. We’re leaving now.’\nThe couple are from Kochi City and driving to each of the temples whenever they have time. In the car, they can cut between the mountains at the heart of Shikoku and get to most places in a few hours. Their SUV cruises through gentle valleys that would take a day of walking. When the conversation trails away, I can’t resist the lull of the car and doze until we stop.\nSome forty-five minutes later, we’re in front of Temple 13. We walk from the parking lot into Dainichi-ji and do our rituals separately. I get the nokyocho first, then wait for them to pick up theirs and chat with the temple staff. When we leave, I give them an osamefuda for the ride.\n‘You’re not coming with us?’ They’re surprised.\nNo, no. I just needed to get to Temple 13, and I can finish the rest walking.\n‘It’s good to be young, isn’t it? Okiotsuketekudasai.‘ We part ways.\nAt the gate, I notice the other aruki henro sitting in the shade with his lunch. He’s picked up a lute. We have a quick exchange, and then I head out the gate as he begins the first notes.\nTemples 14, 15, 16, and 17 are a quick two hours, finished with my adrenaline high from my early morning hike and successful hitchhike. They are clustered within the town sprawl along the train line and look as if they’re having afternoon siestas. I finish my breadsticks at Temple 16, Kanon-ji, without a single soul entering.\nAt Temple 17, my lighter sputters its last breath at the Main Hall. What about the Daishi Hall?! I’m stuck at the finish line, lighter-less, three incense sticks in hand.\nJust then, the lute-player henro from Temple 13 saunters in. Saved! I scurry over and ask to borrow his lighter. He laughs and hands me one.\nA few minutes later, finish line crossed with incense lit and nokyocho procured, I return his lighter.\n‘Keep it, I have a few.’ He chuckles.\nI ask him where he’ll stay tonight and he says he’s just phoned to make a reservation at Otsuru Ryokan, the one I recommended to him earlier. I should have waited for him to make my call! I just informed the obaa-san I’ll be back in the evening. But it’s good, we can catch up later, then. When he gets his lute out to serenade the temple, I head to Kou train station.\nI’m done. Next thing to do: train, and dinner!  I’ve forgotten what a celebratory dinner is. Kaiseki? The fried chicken on the ubiquitous signs, a marker of a local specialty? The izakayas that will open in two hours? Udon? I meander my way through Tokushima’s downtown looking for culinary inspiration.\nAfter browsing the endless options, I slide open the door to a noodle shop just a block away from my ryokan.\n‘Sumimasen, are you open yet?’ The sun has just disappeared behind the hill.\nAn obaa-san emerges from the back of the narrow restaurant. ‘Yes, yes. Dozo, dozo.’ I slide onto the bar counter with a view of the kitchen and the ojii-san who glances up from under his newspaper.\nElbows propped up, I flip through the menu at the options. There are a bewildering ten. It’s an overload.\nThe ojii-san gets up once I decide. He takes his time. I sip my small glass of ice water and refill endlessly.\nFinally, the bowl arrives on a tray. It’s a simple udon with deep-fried tofu skin. Right now, it’s all my simple henro palette needs.\nI clap my hands together. Itadakimasu!\nI slurp the first steaming strands. Kore wa shiawase. This is happiness.\n"});index.add({'id':45,'href':'/book/docs/Diary-Entries/day-40/','title':"Day 40 - July 30",'section':"Diary Entries",'content':"=====\nTokushima Otsuru Ryokan (徳島市大鶴旅館) → Ono Noen 小野農園\nTemples: 10 Kirihata-ji (切幡寺)\nWeather: Sunny\nTravel Method: Cycling\nDistance: 24 km\n=====\nEverything disappears quickly, food included. It takes thirty minutes to eat and pack up the pile of things that I’d left at Otsuru Ryokan. The ‘pile’ had overwhelmed me last night goes into my 25-litre bag with room to spare.\nThe last thing I do is loop my tent to the front, which takes a few tries. It only takes two days to unlearn things you never cared for.\nAt 6:34am, I head downstairs to say goodbye to the obaa-san and pay for my room.\nShe’s serving a breakfast to the French couple having dinner last night when I arrived. They’re heading out to begin their two-week cycling tour of the island which roughly follows the Shikoku Pilgrimage route. Perfect, they’ll need the osamefuda, name slips, and incense I have! With the final exchanges, their meals done, the bags packed, photos taken, they head down the quiet morning street.\nAfter they leave, the obaa-san offers me some coffee and, like last time, gives me a neatly wrapped tube of three softball-sized onigiri.\n‘Where will you be going today?’ she asks.\nI tell her I’d like to return to Temple 10, my first temple, but am not enthusiastic about the route, which is basically a 20km return walking trip from the closest train station.\nEven though it isn’t a requirement, I’d like to complete the circle. The kechigan, completion of the Ohenro, is either finishing the 88 temples, or returning to the temple one started at. It’s up to the pilgrim. For me, the image of arriving back at Kirihata-ji has been the prime motivator to continue since I washed up at Cafe Hikousen in Shishikui on my fourth day, wondering what on earth I was doing walking around an island during rainy season. Standing on those same stones from just a season ago, I will finally be able to see what this island has made of me.\nWell, if I’m to make it, then I should get going.\n8:54am. I’ve just changed my mind.\nAfter passing Kou Station, where I finished yesterday, I go up to the train conductor and pay the additional fare to Kawata Station. My original ticket was to Kamojima Station, the closest one to Kirihata-ji, but still a 10km walk across the Awa Plain. The plan was to walk there and back, then pick up my things from my WWOOFing hosts close to Kawata.\nAfter that…not sure. This uncertainty of where to stay tonight preys on me. There are so many logistics in the air: how to carry my extra baggage, where to stay, when I should activate my JR Pass so that I can travel the rest of the country.\nI look out the window at the familiar fields and houses. It strikes me that I’ve walked most of this train route. There’s nothing to shield from the sun here. The houses are low, the streets wide, and the chequered green fields drooping with green and yellow-headed rice stalks. It was already stuffy at 7am, when I left the ryokan. It will be an oven when I get off the train.\nMy bag has its own seat across from me. The lining is super thin, but has somehow survived unscathed. The henro guide book in my hand is bent and wrinkled. The book cover survived all of Kochi’s downpours only to be soaked by my sweating bottle. I’ve gone to every one of those pages. My original staff has another for company now, one that I picked up at the trailhead of Yokomine-ji. They fit snuggly in my grip together. Edvaldo’s oversized sedge-hat is still in perfect condition.\nI look at my knees. My left one looks so more caved in. When did that happen? Was it always a like this? My skin is now tri-coloured chocolate, golden, and pale white.\nTo be honest, my decision sits uncomfortably. If I go to Kawata, I’ve given up on Kirihata-ji. When I travel, I’m happy to leave things undone in places I love. Why is this is one bothering me so much? Maybe it’s because I don’t know why I want to go, and without going, I’ll never find out. Is it just stubbornness or is there something more? My heart doesn’t stand up to the interrogation of Logic. It can’t articulate why it feels important. So, Logic lists the extra money for the train tickets, the potentially insane price of a taxi if I really don’t want to walk, the long waiting time in rural areas, and the impossibility of hauling the two boxes I’m going to pick up along.\nLogic asks, How much do you want to pay for peace of mind?\nMy heart whimpers. Logic scoffs.\nMaybe I should have just given my hosts a mailing address in Tokyo when they offered so I don’t have to go now. Maybe I should have gone to Temple 10 when I passed by Temple 9. If only. I’m taken aback by how strongly these feelings come.\nNext time. Next time, I will do this trip properly. Heart and Logic shake on an uneasy truce.\n ‘Is Masako-san here?’ I ask a group of people sorting potatoes under a barbecue tent. They eye me for a second, then the tall guy points at the entrance. ‘I think she’s inside.’\nWhen I go in, Masako exclaims, ’A-chan!’ As though I’ve risen from my grave. We never exactly worked out the details of my arrival. I sent her message updates as I got closer. I only told her a day ago that I’d be coming by today to get my things and she’s been too busy to reply.\n‘Tadaima.’ I say sheepishly, the customary ‘I’m back’. Does this count?\n‘Okaeri.’ Her reflexive ‘Welcome back’ is warm.\nI came to the house through the rice fields that I used to cycle past with Shou-san, another WWOOFer, when we were working the scattered plots. Back then, they were uniform green bunches, and now the grain panicles are turning yellow. All this seemed to spread out before. Now, it’s just a thirty-minute walk.\nMy two small boxes are in the corner by the entrance. I’ve already forgotten their contents. Masako pours me a glass of cold barley tea, saying I should rest. Yuji-san comes in, much more healthy than last time, and says, ‘You finished it!’\nI did. Actually, I haven’t burned my daily energy quota yet, so after finishing two glasses, I head out to help the others sort the produce.\nRight now, Ono Farms has another A-chan, Valentin, Yanie, and Nim. The three adjacent rooms separated by the sliding wooden panels are taken up. Yanie and Nim are university students from Hong Kong taking an unorthodox travel approach. Valentin has been studying in Japan and visiting Ono Farms for his last time before he returns to Europe. A-chan does WWOOFing on her holidays to learn more about food since she is a cook in Osaka.\nYanie and Nim take up cooking duties, wondering in Cantonese how they’ve been entrusted to this when they never cook at home. But lunch is a simple squash curry, and the freshly harvested ingredients shine through. This was the celebratory meal I was looking for last night.\nAfter lunch, A-chan helps with preparations for tonight’s barbecue gathering that the local government is hosting. She and Masako-san discuss logistics on food and driving up.\nMasako-san turns to me. ‘A-chan, will you stay tonight? Would you like to come too?’\nActually, can I stay two nights and leave with Yanie and Nim? I want to stay in this little safe harbour a little while longer.\n‘Of course’, she says.\nWith the evening sorted, everyone has the afternoon off, so we retreat to our rooms. On the farms in summer, it is best to work early in the morning and nap between noon and 2pm, the hottest hours, and work into the late evening.\n‘What time are we leaving tonight?’ I ask Yanie and Nim. I heard both four-thirty and five at one point.\nThey don’t know.\n‘But they were discussing it over lunch!’\n‘Yes, in Japanese! No-one tells us anything!’ They fire back good-naturedly.\nOh, that’s true! Masako-san and A-chan were so caught up in the discussion they forgot to relay the decision.\nNever-mind. I confirm with A-chan and realise I have enough time to nap and cycle to Temple 10 after the sun begins to wane. I set my alarm for 2:30pm.\nHome is where friends are.  ‘Please tell Masako-san I’ll be back by 4:55 latest!’ I tell the Hong Kong girls.\nThey laugh. ‘That’s so specific!’\nIt’s 2:45pm, and I’m slathering sunscreen on, rushing out the door after slathering, and grabbing my temple supplies. This was exactly how I started a month and a half ago. Some things change, and some just won’t.\nBorrowing the same bike, I zip off through village roads. Kirihata-ji is twelve kilometres away, just under an hour if I keep a decent speed. I charge through the empty streets, fanned by the wind I’m creating for myself. This is much better than my first time.\nI arrive just before 3:45pm and climb the same steep slope, walk up the same steep flight of stone stairs through the forest.\nI wish I had a bit more time to just sit and enjoy the late afternoon, when the sun is behind the trees but still making the cobblestones glow.\nI feel the cool stones on my knees. This is the first time I’ve knelt at a temple, head bowed, hands together.\nThank you.\nWhatever is out there, whether chance, fate, or divine will, thank you for the safe passage. Thank you for bringing me back. Thank you for providing a solution my Logic had entirely missed. Thank you for leading me back to a home and warm company.\nThe temple’s still the same, but I can read meaning in the details now. Where it once seemed remote and solitary, it now seems tranquil and centred. I wish I could stay longer, but I need to get the nokyocho. For the first time in forty days, rather than moving on, I am returning home.\nI arrive back home at 4:45pm. It’s cutting it close. As they say — carpe diem. Seize the day – and throttle it by the neck.\nI present Masako the nokyocho. Ono Farm launched me on my pilgrimage and unconditionally helped me finish. This is the least I can do.\nAnyhow, the others are loading the food into the car. I’m glad to join them, returning to a normal life with company, chatter, and laughter. After, Valentin and I cycle up the hill towards the onsen while the others hop in the car.\nThe handful of people at the site are already prepared to feed a village. Everyone is pitching in to make the last preparations, cutting, skewering, lighting the fire, chilling the drinks and fruits, lighting mosquito incense. Voices clamber over each other with questions and instructions. The chaos and confusion is rural Japan’s warm embrace. A knife is picked up, a cutting demonstration, a point at the produce, fingers for amounts, nods, smiles. In a kitchen, everyone can pick up the language of care in food and what we do with it.\nI watch dusk descend on the Awa Plain, the flat expanse sprinkled with street lights, the patchwork fields worked for centuries, protected by two walls of mountains, and split by the Yoshino River.\nI look back at the group that’s doubled in size and trebled in volume. Here I am, in a place half forgotten by the rest of Japan, with the largest BBQ spread I’ve seen. One lady points at the plate of wrapped yams with instructions. There’s a team on the grill. The drinks are passed around.\n‘A-chan, the food is ready! Let’s eat!’\nA woman points at an open spot. Someone shifts over. I sit down beside Yanie and Nim. The Ono Farm group take up one end of the table. The host gets up to say a few words and we toast. The first batch of veggies and meat is passed down the long table.\nItadakimasu! We dig in with big bites, loud yelps, and covered mouths. It’s hot!\nFor an event I once did, we did a trailer asking our speakers, ‘If life was a box of chocolates, what have you gotten so far?’\nLooking around, I finally recognize my box. This. All this.\n"});index.add({'id':46,'href':'/book/docs/Resources/mt-ishizuchi-transport/','title':"A Guide to Mount Ishizuchi",'section':"Resources",'content':"This is a comprehensive guide for people who would like to climb Mount Ishizuchi, the tallest mountain in Western Japan. The guide covers the two main transportation routes to the trailheads from Matsuyama and JR Iyo-Saijo Station respectively. Both routes have a day-hiking, overnight camping, and ryokan lodging options. All Shikoku Pass or JR Pass users can consider taking the train to Iyo-Saijo to make this a day activity.\nThis guide also includes hiking route time estimates, some activities or highlights of notes, and lodging options.\nPlease note that this guide was migrated from an old blog and still needs some formatting updates. Please be patient (or help if you know how to use markdown). Thanks!\nInformation Overview of Mount Ishizuchi Looking towards the peak of Western Japan, Tengudake, at 1982 metres.\nMount Ishizuchi is the tallest mountain in Western Japan, with its peak Tengudake sitting at 1982 metres. The mountain is both a cultural landmark as a holy site for Shinto and Shugendo, as well as a popular hiking route for recreational and overnight hikers. The mountain has a signature sheer peak and is famous for its three sets of gigantic chains that climbers can use to get to the top (optional use). In the Fall, Mount Ishizuchi is famous for koyo, autumn foliage, where it attracts many visitors. In the Winter, it has a new years mountain festival, but I would not advise on hiking, as the mountain has snow and is a ski ground. Officially, the mountain hiking route is open between July and October, though you could probably hike it in late Spring and Fall as well.\nIshizuchi’s Hiking Season \u0026amp; Trail Recommendations\nThe last of the 3 famous chains to reach Mount Ishizuchi’s peak.\nHowever, visitors should note that the mountain is high enough to have snow, so you can consider that the mountain is “closed” for hiking in winter.\nMount Ishizuchi’s paths are well-kept and natural. This means that the routes are dirt paths that are kept clear of weeds and fallen leaves. As the paths are natural, heavy rains can create extremely muddy troughs.\nI highly recommend giving yourself at least one overnight stay to enjoy the highland air and natural scenes. If you are adhering to the bus schedule, you will have to walk fairly quickly and there won’t be much time to sit and just take in the view. For trekkers coming from Matsuyama, you can either stay at Kuma Kogen where the bus transfer is, or on top of Mount Ishizuchi.\nOther hiking routes around Mount Ishizuchi\nMount Ishizuchi is connected by a series of hiking trails that can go to other peaks such as Mount Iwaguro 岩畔, Mount Otoko 男山, Mount Kamegamori 瓶ヶ森山, Mount Daigamori 代ヶ森, Mount Komochi-gongen 子持権現山, and Mount Ibuki 伊吹山. There are some rest huts and cabins up in the mountains that are like shacks without any amenities. Please also refer to this to this Ishizuchi Map.\nTransportation Overview\nFrom JR Iyo-Saijo Station, day-hikers can take a bus and cable car up to the mountain to complete the Omotesando Route and catch public transportation back. Transportation to Ishizuchi from Matsuyama takes a bit longer to get to and requires hikers to climb the full height of the mountain.\nBelow is a general breakdown to help you figure out what route might be suitable for your trip itinerary and the transportation needed to get to Mount Ishizuchi’s trail heads.\n   DAY HIKE OVERNIGHT      From Matsuyama Bus to Ishizuchi Tsuchigoya Bus to Omogo   From JR Iyo-Saijo Bus to Ishizuchi Ropeway + Cable Car Bus to Ishizuchi Ropeway only   From Yokomine-ji  Walk from Yokomine-ji    The guide below is formatted by where you are coming from. In each of the main sections, you will find additional information on transit times, basic hiking route information, and notes on accommodation. Below are three main places travellers start from to get to Mount Ishizuchi:\n Matsuyama to Ishizuchi-Tsuchigoya Matsuyama to Omogo Matsuyama to Kuma Kogen (and day hikes in the area) JR Iyo Saijo Station to Ishizuchi Ropeway JR Iyo Saijo Station to the Omotesando Route Yokomine-ji, Temple #60 in the Shikoku Pilgrimage   From Matsuyama to Ishizuchi-Tsuchigoya (Direct) Click here for Google Map\nThe closest main city to Mount Ishizuchi is Matsuyama, which is the capital of Ehime Prefecture and also has an airport. There is public transportation directly to 2 trailheads for Mount Ishizuchi. The further trailhead (Omogo) runs year round, but the closer trailhead (Tsuchigoya) is only during the season when the mountain is open.\nThe “Botchan Clock” at Dogo Onsen is a landmark in Matsuyama\nHikers going directly from JR Matsuyama Station will need to do a bus transfer at the town of Kuma Kogen. The first bus is takes you from JR Matsuyama Station to Kuma Kogen and is run by JR Shikoku Bus. The second bus is run by Iyotetsu Buses and takes you from the Kuma Kogen Business Office to Omogo. Note that buses to Ishizuchi-Tsuchigoya only operate on weekends and holidays.\nPlease refer to the bus service time tables below for the two daily bus routes to Tsuchigoya. For hikers who would like to hike from the further trailhead at Omogo, please proceed further down for additional bus times.\n**Iyotetsu Nanyo Bus Summer Service Times: **\n Operates April 1 – November 30 Saturdays, Sundays, and Holidays 2 buses a day only There are more daily buses to Omogo  Buses from Matsuyama JR Station to Ishizuchi-Tsuchigoya (via Kuma Kogen)    JR Shikoku Bus  Iyotetsu Nanyo Bus（Summer) Weekends Only       JR Matsuyama Station Kuma Kogen Kuma Business Centre Omogo Ishizuchi Tsuchigoya   Departs Departs Departs Departs Arrives   6:30 7:32 7:50 8:50 9:28   10:30 11:33 14:00 15:02 15:40    Buses Ishizuchi-Tsuchigoya (Via Kuma Kogen) to Matsuyama JR Station    JR Shikoku Bus   Iyotetsu Nanyo Bus（Summer) Weekends Only      JR Matsuyama Station Kuma Kogen Kuma Business Centre Omogo Ishizuchi Tsuchigoya   Departs Departs Departs Departs Arrives   6:30 7:32 7:50 8:50 9:28   10:30 11:33 14:00 15:02 15:40    Source: Ishizuchi Bus Information (Japanese PDF)\nNote that this information is provided for simplicity.

It also has 2 hostel listings.\nNote that bus service to this route is only available between April 1 and November 30. From the bus stop, there is a public toilet before you ascend the mountain. In addition, you can stop by Ishizuchi Shrine, with the sacred grounds marked by a red torii gate before your ascent. Note that there are 2 routes up the mountain.\nRoute 1 (approx 2.5 hours one-way): The most direct route, via Mount Tsuru-no-ko-no-Kashira 鶴の子の頭. Note that this route comes up behind the mountain, which means you will not be climbing the three famous chains.\nRoute 2 (approx 4.5 hours one-way): This route is multisectional, so look for the signs that point you to Mount Ishizuchi 石鎚山.\n From Matsuyama to Omogo Click here for Google Map Link\nThis is section is additional information for people who want to head into the highlands in general, or who may want to stay overnight for a day or two. JR Shikoku buses run daily between Matsuyama Station and Kuma Kogen town as public transportation. Below are some of the main stops between Matsuyama and Kuma Kogen town.\nBelow, I have compiled the public bus time schedules. However, I believe the transfer bus stop between the JR Shikoku Bus and the Iyotetsu Bus are not not the terminus stops. To ensure you get off at the right place, please say to, or show, the bus driver:\n “Ishizuchi-yama ni ikmasu. Norikae no basu-tei ni tomattekudasai.”\n石鎚山に行きます。乗換のバス停に止まってください。\n Please note that some buses only run on weekdays and others only on weekends.\nFrom Matsuyama JR Station to Omogo     JR Shikoku Bus  Iyotetsu Nanyo Bus (Summer Service）       JR Matsuyama Station Kuma Chugaku Mae Kuma Kogen Omogo    Departs Departs Departs Departs   Sat/Sun/Hol 6:30 7:32 7:50 8:50   Weekdays 6:30 7:32 9:30 10:30   Weekdays 8:30 9:36 11:00 12:00   Sat/Sun/Hol 10:30 11:33 14:00 15:02   Weekdays 10:30 11:33 14:35 15:35   Weekdays 15:50 16:58 17:50 18:50    From Omogo to Matsuyama JR Station     Iyotetsu Nanyo Bus (Summer Service）  JR Shikoku Bus       Omogo Kuma Kogen Kuma Chugaku Mae JR Matsuyama Station    Departs Departs Departs Arrives   Weekdays 6:55 7:55 8:01 9:06   Weekdays 8:30 9:30 10:11 11:15   Sat/Sun/Hol 12:10 13:04 15:11 16:19   Weekdays 12:30 13:30 15:11 16:19   Sat/Sun/Hol 17:05 18:00 18:41 19:49   Weekdays 17:10 18:04 18:41 19:49    Source: Iyotetsu Bus Timetable (Japanese PDF) and JR Shikoku Bus timetable for the Matsuyama – Kuma Kogen route (Japanese)\nHiking Route from Omogo to Mount Ishizuchi The Ishizuchi view towards the Omoge and Kuma Kogen direction.\nTime from Kamebara Cliff (One-Way): 3 – 4 hours\nIf you get off at Omogo Stop, you will have to walk about 1 kilometre to various sight seeing spots, and about 3 kilometres to the trailhead 登山口.\nWhen you get off, you will be walking along a stream and you can follow signs to the Maple Leaf Rock, also called the Momiji Rock. That area has a few famous sights, such as the Yoroi Rock, Nunobiki Waterfall, and the Kamebara Cliff. After you pass the camping sites, you will get to a final washroom at the trail head 登山口. There is only one main hiking route, but you can look for signs that say Mount Omogo 面河山 and Mount Ishizuchi 石鎚山. This part of the route takes about 2.5 hours one-way.\n From Matsuyama to Kuma Kogen Only Click here for the Google Map of the route.\nFinally, for people who want to go to the highlands, here are the buses that go to the town of Kuma Kogen.

The town itself has cultural and hiking options as well. In fact, if you want a quicker, but highly interesting cultural hiking route, you can walk the Shikoku Pilgrimage. The route from Daihou Temple to Iwaya Temple is actually a historical mountain path. You can read more about the two temples and see photos from my diary entry for the Shikoku Pilgrimage. If you would like further information on activities and accommodation, please get in touch.\n From JR Iyo-Saijo to Mount Ishizuchi Getting to JR Iyo-Saijo Station JR Iyo-Saijo Station is in between the main cities of Matsuyama, Ehime Prefecture, and Takamatsu, Kagawa Prefecture. The station is serviced by both local trains and express trains. Note that not all express trains will stop at this station.\nNote that if you would like to make this a comfortable day-trip, I suggest that you take the earliest train possible that allows you to catch the earliest bus (departing from JR Iyo-Saijo Station at 7:47am). This will give you more time on the mountain. If you plan to stay overnight on Mount Ishizuchi, you have much more flexibility.\nThe three main cities with express trains going to Iyo-Saijo Station are:\n Takamatsu: *Ishizuchi *express trains Okayama: *Shiokaze *express trains Matsuyama: *Shiokaze *express train  In addition to this, there are local trains. For this reason, the best thing to do is to do a direct search to Iyo Saijo Station on Google Maps to get a sense of your options. To search for a suitable train time, click “Directions”, input your trip starting point, and also click the “Leave Now” dropdown button and select “Arrive by” and you can input your exact date of travel, and the time you want to arrive by. The safe times to arrive by are 7:30, 10:15, 13:30, 16:15 so that you can catch one of the 4 daily buses to Mount Ishizuchi.\nExpress trains are comfortable, scenic, the best choice for travellers with an All-Shikoku Pass or JR Pass for all of Japan. If you do not have these passes, then make sure you check the price of the ticket so as not to be surprised. Express trains usually have two, combined ticket prices: one for the route, and the second for a “seat” on the express train itself, even if it is free seating 自由席. You can check the prices of the express trains on Hyperdia.\n From JR Iyo-Saijo Station to Ishizuchi’s base After you arrive at JR Iyo-Saijo Station, you will need to take the bus to Mount Ishizuchi. The bus costs ¥1000 one-way and you can pay in cash when you get in.\nWait for the bus here outside JR Iyo-Saijo Station\nThe bus stop is right outside the JR Iyo-Saijo Station. Look for a bus that says: JR伊予西条駅 → 石鎚ロープウェイ前. There was no English when I did the trip. You take the bus to the last stop, called Nishinokawa.\nBus stop at Ishizuchi\nIf you are standing at the main bus stop and have arrived before the departure time, you can be sure you do not miss your bus. Buses in the countryside may arrive late, but they will almost never depart early. If they are running early, they will usually wait until their scheduled departure time. If you are unsure, you can follow the people who look like they are going hiking. Usually, they will have gear such as walking sticks.\n**From Iyo-Saijo Station to Ishizuchi’s base (Nishinokawa) **\n**JR Iyo-Saijo Station** **Nishinokawa (Last Stop)** 07:47 08:43 10:27 11:23 13:37 14:33 16:23 17:19 Source: [Setouchi Bus (Japanese Only)](http://www.setouchibus.co.jp/)  From Nishinokawa and Ishizuchi Ropeway to Iyo-Saijo Station  **Nishinokawa (First Stop)** **JR Iyo-Saijo Station** Weekdays Only 06:54 07:50 Daily 09:10 10:06 Daily 12:00 12:56 Daily 15:15 16:11 Daily 17:20 18:17 Source: [Setouchi Bus (Japanese Only)](http://www.setouchibus.co.jp/)  Hiking Route from the base of Mount Ishizuchi at Nishinokawa The trailhead to Mount Ishizuchi should have a marker. If you need to use the toilet first, you should get off at the “Ropeway” stop before Nishinokawa and go to the toilet at the cable car station first. After that, it is about a 15 minute walk to Nishinokawa.\nPlease note that the description of this route covers only from the bus stop and base of the mountain. For hikers who follow Route 1, please also refer to the Omotesando route below that starts from above the cable car station. The time estimate in this section should be added to the additional time needed near the top of the mountain.\n**Route 1 (Approx 3 hours to join main route): To Ishizuchi Shrine and Omotesando Route **The main route should be clearly marked and basically follows along the slopes that the cable car goes up. This route joins the “Omotesando” day hike route in the section below. This means that the 3 hours you hike up this route is in addition to the hike to the peak of Mount Ishizuchi.\nRoute 2: Advanced Route(s) At the first major trail fork, there will be a left route. This route is advanced and has further splits up the mountain. The various options will include joining part of the Omotesando main route, joining only in the last section with the climbing chains, or hugging Mount Omori and skipping Mount Ishizuchi altogether. That route eventually takes you down to the main Ishizuchi Shrine and the bus stop “Ishizuchi Tsuchigoya”, which is only serviced on weekends and goes to Kuma Kogen. If you take the most advanced route that still goes to Tengudake (Mount Ishizuchi’s peak), you should expect the whole route to take around 6 hours of continuous walking. You can look at this PDF map to get a sense of options from Nishinokawa bus stop.\n From JR Iyo-Saijo Station to the Ishizuchi Omotesando Route (Day Hike) The Ishizuchi Joju Shrine where the trailhead begins.\n*Omotesando hiking route from the Ishizuchi Cable Car (1400 metres) and Joju Shrine to the peak of Mount Ishizuchi (1982 metres), the tallest mountain in Western Japan, in Ehime Prefecture on Shikoku. This guide tells you how to get to Mount Ishizuchi from Matsuyama JR Station via Kuma Kogen and Iyo Saijo Station, via Yokomine-ji. This post will also give you rough estimates of route length and time expected, as most of the routes will require at least one overnight. *\nFrom Iyo-Saijo Station to Ishizuchi Please refer to the time tables in the section above for bus times.\nThe Mount Ishizuchi Cable Car The gift shop at the top of the cable car station has snacks.\nThe Ishizuchi cable car car runs every 20 minutes during regular days an every 10 minutes during peak season. This means that it departs on the hour, as well as every 0:20, and 0:40.\nFrom December until March, the Ishizuchi area has a running ski ground. For winter visitors, you can check the ski ground hours (Japanese).\n Jan 2 – April 8:40 ～ 17:00  ※ Dec – Mar the Ski grounds are open May \u0026amp; June Weekdays Sat, Sun, Holidays 8:40 ～ 17:00 7:40 ～ 18:00 Ishizuchi Festival (July 1 ～10) Weekdays Sat \u0026amp; Sun 4:20 ～ 18:20 3:00 ～ 18:20 July 11～ August Weekdays Sat, Sun, Holidays, Obon 8:00 ～ 18:00 7:20 ～ 18:20 September Weekdays Satu, Sun, Holidays 8:40 ～ 17:00 7:40 ～ 18:00 October ～ November 3 Weekdays Sat, Sun, Holidays 8:20 ～ 17:00 7:40 ～ 18:00 November 4 ～ December Daily 8:40 ～ 17:00 ※ Late Dec ～Early March the Ski ground hours New Year’s Day (Jan 1) 4:00 ～ 17:00 NO SERVICE April 6 – 12\nThe Omotesando Hiking Route from the Ropeway and Joju Shrine Time from Joju Shrine Trail Head (One-Way): 3 hours\nThis is a useful 2-page English guide for the Omotesando hiking route, which includes information on accommodation.\nThe Omotesando route officially starts at the Ishizuchi Jōju Shrine (about 1400m), where there is a wooden gate with spirit guardians. Note that the last section has a series of 3 famous climbing chains, which are 33 metres, 65 metres and 68 metres respectively. You can refer to my climbing time log with the Strava App below:\nNote on the return If you are returning on the same route via the cable car, then look for the signs that say Joju 成就. Note that the last bus leaving Mount Ishizuchi Ropeway is around 5:20pm, so you should catch the 4:40 cable car at the latest.\nIt is also possible to go down the mountain through other paths, such as to Tsuchigoya (look for signs where the second chain is). *Tsuchinoya *has 2 buses on weekends only that take you out to Kuma Kogen, where you can transfer to Matsuyama. Please refer to the bus time tables in the section above on transportation from Matsuyama. You can also take a longer route down to Omogo as well, which has daily buses to Kuma Kogen, but do note when the last bus departs.\n From Yokomine-ji for Shikoku Pilgrimage Henro If you are an Ohenro-san, you have probably heard of Mount Ishizuchi in the guide. I think Mount Ishizuchi is absolutely worth the climb from Spring to Fall (not winter). Note that climbing Mount Ishizuchi will definitely take one or two extra days.\nThis route requires no transportation, as the assumption is that you will be hiking directly from Yokomine-ji through the mountains. If you are taking the bus, please refer to the sections above on transit to and from JR Iyo-Saijo Station.\nThe Imamiya Route Just before the three chains climbing to the peak of Ishizuchi.\nTime from Yokomine-ji: 5-8 hours\nFrom Yokomine-ji, you should be following a narrow concrete car road down the mountain that eventually begins to follow the Kamo River. You will need to follow the river until you reach the bus stop called Koguchi 河口. This route takes about 2 hours.\nFrom Koguchi, which means mouth of the river, you will begin the climb the Imamiya Route. The Imamiya Route is a mountain path and takes between 3-5 hours. You will know you are at the end of the route when you arrive at the Ishizuchi Joju Shrine and the mountain town with ryokans.\nFor the route information from the town please go up to the section titled “The Omotesando Hiking Route from the Ropeway and Joju Shrine” for a more detailed description. For more information on accommodation, please continue down below to the Accommodation section.\nFor Shikoku Pilgrims Walking the Whole Route If you are a pilgrim who is walking the whole way, then you will probably need to retrace your step after ascending Mount Ishizuchi. The most direct route down the mountain will be to follow the Omotesando Route to the Joju Shrine and cable car station. From there, you can retrace the Imamiya Route out to Koguchi. Koguchi is the name of the bus stop that takes you out to Iyo-Saijo Station, but you will also recognise it when you see the road. If you don’t take the bus, you can continue to follow the Kamo River down the mountain, and back out to Temples #61 and #62.\nFor Taking Transit back to Temples #61 or #64 If you are open to taking the bus back out of the mountains to resume your walk, please refer to the section above on cable car and bus times to JR Iyo-Saijo. If you walked directly from Yokomine-ji, Temple #60, you will have to take the train back to Temple #61 to continue walking.\nIf you are more flexible with your route, then a better way would be to walk Temples #61 – #64 first as they are close together. Then do Yokomine-ji (Temple #60), and hike up to Mount Ishizuchi from there. As you have already walked to the other temples, you can continue walking immediately towards Temple #65 after the bus drops you off at JR Iyo-Saijo.\n Additional Information Accommodations Around Ishizuchi There is a mountain lodge beside this office at the peak.\nYou can refer to the ryokans listed on this map and also look for rest huts along the trail. If you would like more detailed information, please contact me.\n Climbing Etiquette in Japan Japan is a safe place to climb mountains and many routes are cared for by local communities. For this reason, this is a gentle reminder to go by the principle of taking everything off the mountain with you, so that you leave it in the same beautiful state you found it. Below are a few additional cultural notes to help you on your hike on Ishizuchi, as well as other mountains on Shikoku.\n*Use the spray to flush the toilet, which is on Mount Ishizuchi and other mountains. *\n Keep your garbage and take it down the mountain **Say ‘*konichiwa’ ***as a friendly ‘hello’, which the hiking community frequently does **Say ‘sumimasen‘, **which means ‘excuse me’ to pass people, or step in to use something (such as a water fountain) Keep conversation voices low as noise travels far Follow instructions in washrooms because the waste gets flushed right onto the mountain  *A reference for Japanese maps, which are generally rough ideas and not to scale. *\nLunching at Tengudake!\n"});index.add({'id':47,'href':'/book/about/','title':"About",'section':"About",'content':"Preamble This is the archive of a digital diary that became a Wordpress blog back in 2015. The Shikoku Pilgrimage diary covers my 40-day mostly walking trip around Japan\u0026rsquo;s forth largest island. It has been stripped down to its text. I will also prepare a PDF / eBook version that has some of the photos I included in my original diary.\nAt the time, I took notes en route and formalised them into entries that are about 2000 words long each. The first version was intended to help other foreign pilgrims who may also have struggled to find information at the time and included resources such as glossaries and extensive links.\nA basic copy-paste of the original resource pages remains on this mini-site. They include budget lodgings in bilingual English and Japanese, a glossary of terms, a budget breakdown, and a map for the temple coordinates. I do not think they are as necessary as they used to be, when I had gone through Shikoku without a data SIM card and without nearly as many Japan travel apps and resources.\nThis version has been lightly edited from its original. At the time, the posts were experimental and I had been focused on capturing my state of mind because the experience was formative and still guides how I move about the world. Reading these entries five years later, I recognise those thoughts even though I have moved on from being the person who had them.\nI no longer have the same compulsion to explain my writing. One day, I will sit down to write a more readable version.\nIn the meantime, I hope this is either helpful or entertaining for you.\nAthena 2020 November\n How It Started Notes from 2016\nI fell into the Shikoku pilgrimage on an arranged coincidence.\nI discovered the pilgrimage shortly after leaving a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to contribute to Hong Kong’s first maker space, a project that I believed in so strongly it justified risking staying in a city I love but have deep ambivalence for. It was an opportunity that was ridiculous to pass up on, but after trying for a few months, it was not going to work. The maker space now has a team, bigger location, and more programs.\nBy spring in 2015, I could travel again. I hashed out my priorities. Whatever I was going to occupy myself doing had to fulfill the following:\n Be in Japan (summer is nice, and I have an affinity for the place) Be somewhere rural (wanted to be in nature, not cities) Have an active lifestyle (to burn my daily excess energy) While remaining super cheap (because I had no income)  They were simple and open points, but surprisingly difficult for traditional travel styles (even backpacking) to fulfill.\nIn a blitz of research, I discovered a hike to a Mounnt Koya (Koya-San) that would take a day. Then, I learned it was part of a pilgrimage network known as the Kumano Kodo, which is well-kept in various parts and promised to be wonderfully wild in others. Google’s search results of moss-covered stairs were exciting, perhaps too adventurous. At the time, I had solid shoestring backpacker credentials by sleeping in airports and train stations and a deep appreciation for wilderness having grown up with black bears for neighbours. I had never done multi-day hikes, much less camped alone.\nI kept searching. Could there be another walking route that skirted close to civilisation and its comforts? That rabbit hole emerged onto Japan’s fourth largest island of Shikoku, which is traced by a pilgrimage centuries old – the Ohenro – dotted with ‘henro huts’ to shelter in, and packed with anecdotes of local generosity.\nDespite the immediate logistical challenges I imagined, my heart was already nudging, ‘Go.’\nI did it because it seemed like a good challenge at the time.\nI had enough basic Japanese to get by, and this was a chance to improve it. Japan’s about the safest country to travel alone in. I liked the simple premise of the pilgrimage: hit 88 temples, however you want, whenever you want.\nIt was only near the end of my pilgrimage that someone told me Shikoku calls to the pilgrims who walk it. When it had been just pixels on a screen outlining a butterfly island, the call had been simple: Just try. Simple, inviting, forgiving.\nMy insecurities could span several pages. Could I walk for a day? Could I walk for a month? Could I survive monsoon, and then a hellish summer? Why should I be walking during the worst season, the one all veterans recommend against? Would I lose my way? Was it really safe for a woman? Can I sleep out in the open? In parking lots? How much weight could I carry? Imagining the potential challenges, I realised how little I knew about myself. Those questions seemed like invitations to find out. My heart was halfway out the door. Let’s go for a walk.\nMy head raised an eyebrow. You’re biting off more than you can chew.\nThe heart muses, Probably.\nThe head says, We have no idea what we’re doing.\nThe heart chirps, That’s okay. That’s what you’re here for.\nI was adrift, bobbing along with nothing on the horizon. My ambitious brain instinctively wanted to swim for shore, anywhere, and get on with Life. It would have drowned trying. My heart is used to riding waves and weathering storms, floating back to the surface, a little more battered but still buoyant.\nThat’s how I ended up in Shikoku, walking, for who knows what, to God knows where. In retrospect, I appreciate something that I hadn’t thought much of at the time: setting off without mission or purpose.\nMy heart and brain agreed on the bottom line: Shikoku wouldn’t kill me. What would this island make of me?\n"});})();
