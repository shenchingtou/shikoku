Morning. Fold futon. Open curtains. Sunshine. It rained. Pack. Eat.
I move around as quietly as I can. Aurelie is still sleeping, and I enjoy extending morning quiet before the day begins.
At some point, something clatters and I hear Aurelie wake.</description>

Kiragawa 吉良川 → Kōnomine-ji 神峰寺
Temples: 27 Kōnomine-ji (神峰寺)
Weather: Sunny
Travel Method: Walking
Distance: 25 km
=====
My cell is going to die. That’s my first thought when I wake with it squashed under my shoulder, overheated and drained of the full battery it had last night. I can feel the film of sweat on my face, even though I woke up several times from the breeze that carried increasingly cool air.</description>

Temples: None
Weather: Sunny
Travel Method: Walking
Distance: 35.3 km
=====
I woke up in the middle of the night only once, which is an accomplishment. I wake again in the dark before 5:00 because I had originally wanted to climb to the peak and see sunrise. Finally, my alarm goes off again at 6:00, and I’m behind schedule.</description>

=====
The birds begin chirping just before night melts into dawn. It’s not even 5:00am. I peek over at the henro on the other side of the hut. He hasn’t stirred. Feeling justified, I pull up my covers again.</description>

Weather: Cloudy with Sunny Parts
Travel Method: Walking
Distance: 17.1 km
=====
My alarm goes off in the pitch-black room. I resent it with a passion I never felt when woken by sunshine and the cheerful birds after a sleepless nojuku night. In the fog of fatigue after a first good night’s rest, I drag myself out of the fluffy comforter and soft bed, change, and head downstairs for the complimentary breakfast.</description>

=====
While the coffee is brewing I drop a slice of sumomo, sour peach, in my mouth. In the bowl beside the red juicy cuts are yellow ones from the Tosa Buntan, a local pomelo-like fruit. My host brought them over from her parents’ house next door.</description>

=====
Today is a series of unfortunate events, but it started off beautifully.
I get up early to enjoy breakfast before leaving my Airbnb house. This is my chance to eat a full spread unlike the usual onigiri and snacks that I have on the go.</description>

Temples: None
Weather: Rain
Travel Method: Walking + Train
Distance: 18.7 (+ 19) km
=====
I wake up to a morning drizzle and check my foot. It’s still the size of a golfball, but curiously not an angry purple.
I’m lucky. A millimetre off and I would probably be back in Kochi City, in the hospital. I stop myself from looping yesterday’s fall in my head, from thinking about that one fateful moment, that one avoidable step.</description>

Temples: 37 (Iwamoto-ji 岩本寺)
Weather: Rain
Travel Method: Walking
Distance: 18.7 km
=====
My alarm goes off and I reluctantly unzip my tent flap, poke my head out, and sit up on the bench.
Cleaning up, packing, having breakfast, chugging half of the two-litre bottle to offload weight fill up my first hour. Whether I rush or take my time, I’ve discovered don’t stray far from this hour mark.</description>

Somewhere in Takaoka-gun (高岡郡)
Temples: None
Weather: Cloudy + Rain
Travel Method: None!
Distance: 0 km
=====
 ‘Stay’ is a charming word in a friend’s vocabulary. – Louisa May Alcott  Stay has enticed travellers to lay down roots, caused vagabonds to give up their wanders. Mystics and monks in deep jungles and remote mountains entice nomads to become disciples and they never leave their hamlet retreats again. Whether spoken by a life-long friend or a newfound connection, the word has equal power when the stars align.</description>

Kaina Station → Michi-no-Eki Bios Oogata (道の駅ビオス おおがた) Temples: None
Weather: Cloudy
Travel Method: Walking
Distance: 24.2 km
=====
The day starts early, too unjustly early for a departure. This is a good life, a good home, a good river outside, with good hills.
We have breakfast and I pack the last items into my backpack as my host starts the car. Where did the morning go?
My host and I have our last good chat on the way to Kubokawa station, where she’ll drop me off on the way to work.</description>

Michi-no-Eki Bios Oogata (道の駅ビオス おおがた) → Shimonokae (下ノ加江)
Temples: None
Weather: Cloudy + Rain
Travel Method: Walking
Distance: 28 km
=====
Last night was meh. That sound synthesises a relatively comfortable spot (under a table), feeling comfortable (mostly not too hot or cold), a full belly (from snacks), general feeling of safety (could see incoming traffic), and a decent 8 hours of sleep (broken).
After forcing myself to sleep despite the sheen of sweat on my forehead, I drifted awake when the cool air sank in.</description>

Weather: Cloudy + Sunny
Travel Method: Walking + Bus + Train
Distance: 24.7 (+51.7) km
=====
I set my alarm for 5am and it’s barely twilight by the time I get out from the covers. Instantly, I regret laying out my dryish clothes last night; the humidity has tampered with them. Never mind. I pack and eat breakfast, finishing the rest of the cold barley tea from last night.</description>

=====
Tired of trying to sleep, I get up at 4:30am.
I spent the past four hours lying on the hard plastic chairs – the ones that curve up into ridges – on the platform waiting room at Hirata station.</description>
