Kawata -&amp;gt; Hourinji –&amp;gt; Kawata
Temples: 9 (Hourin-ji 法輪寺), 10 (Kirihata-ji 切幡寺)
Weather: Cloudy
Method: Cycling
Distance: 31.8km
=====
My first two temples in the Shikoku 88 Temple Pilgrimage were chosen, as it were, by fate. After a long morning assisting my WWOOF host run a tofu-making class for mothers and their toddlers, I had the afternoon off. Though the farm is far from the Shikoku Pilgrimage’s starting point near Tokushima City, I realise that it is close enough to one of the temples deeper in the Awa Valley.</description>

Tokushima Otsuru Ryokan (徳島市大鶴旅館) → Ono Noen 小野農園
Temples: 10 Kirihata-ji (切幡寺)
Weather: Sunny
Travel Method: Cycling
Distance: 24 km
=====
Everything disappears quickly, food included. It takes thirty minutes to eat and pack up the pile of things that I’d left at Otsuru Ryokan. The ‘pile’ had overwhelmed me last night goes into my 25-litre bag with room to spare.
The last thing I do is loop my tent to the front, which takes a few tries.</description>

Sleep, glorious sleep. Last night at around 8pm, I passed out from exhaustion and aches when there was still an evening glow. When I drifted awake at 4am, I still had creaky knees and sore muscles. By 7am, I roll out of my futon with taught legs.</description>

Travel Method: Walking
Distance: 22.7 km
=====
At 5:30am, Kouhei is already done packing his tent and sitting on the bench. Why does he have to be so Japanese (early)?!
I roll out of Aurelie’s tent inhale the morning dew on the grass. Despite an initially sleepless night, it was one of the best sleeps I’ve had.</description>

All the other capsules remain silent as I crawl out of my cozy unit-bed. The room is a contained darkness lit by a glow of mini LEDs on the floor. I push open the door and exit into the lit world with carpets and pastel beige colours.</description>

Last night averaged out alright. After being turned away by Iyadani-ji, I relaxed in the onsen down the hill, snacked on o-settai cookies, napped on a lounge chair until midnight, and found a covered bench beside the onsen entrance, sheltered from the rain, as my final sleeping spot.</description>

It’s 8:10am and I drop my bags on Jizo’s lap. This is the same Jizo statue I’d always give a nod to even when I was reduced to mechanical reflex by heat and exhaustion. Why were there so many benches at the base of the trail and none up here when you really need it?</description>

Two big, heavy, onigiri courtesy of the hotel! I stow them in my backpack and finish the rest of my cheese and bread breakfast in the lobby. The guest laundry is waving outside on the veranda.
I message friends using the hotel WiFi.</description>

 ばかはろくでもないものにかねをつかう、賢いやつはじぶんの成長のためにつかう。おとこのかちはかねの使い方でわかるもんさ。
The fool will spend his money on worthless things. The wise will spend his money to better himself. A man’s worth can be measured by how he spends his money.
 – Silverspoon (2013)   I wake up with the sound of footsteps outside. The station has a pale golden glow just before sunrise.</description>

I really wish I had enough sleep. But, I also wouldn’t trade the two extra hours we took to make the apple crumble. For a henro, a 6:30am breakfast is so late. It’s Akiko’s 365-Day Breakfast Special, in her own words. Special every day, methinks. Just as I’m finishing up, Tsuneto comes with a severe face.</description>

Weather: Sunny
Travel Method: Walking (Train Return to Imabari)
Distance: 26.8 (+15.8) km
=====
5:00am wake up. In about 10 minutes, my messy spread has disappeared into my backpack. It makes me wonder why I even have those things – even a backpack feels like an excess now. Small moments like these get me. They make me pause, feeling like I’ve shed another shell, but don’t have clear enough vision to see what the old one was like.</description>

Typhoon day! It’s forecasted to make landfall tonight, so I still have the morning to visit the temples clustered around Imabari. My hosts, having walked the Ohenro themselves, urge me to get up earlier.
The train lines are down until at least noon.</description>

Today is a late day because Noriko-san, the Couchsurfing friend I’d met yesterday, is driving me up to Temples 44 and 45. Even though I was looking forward to a mountain trail between the two temples, a car is a much more realistic solution.</description>

Glorious sleep, oh glorious sleep. Real henro holiday. Henro-related things: zero. Today is errand day and lunch with a Couchsurfing host. I drift into the living room, savour the yogurt, cereal, and cut fruits. I step outside onto the covered veranda and my laundry baked dry. Clean. And it will stay clean for at least another day.</description>

Holiday! Today, I’m going to Dogo Onsen, which was mentioned in Japan’s earliest collection of poetry, the Man’yōshū, and reportedly the inspiration behind Studio Ghibli’s Spirited Away. Even the semi-legendary Prince Shotoku, credited with sponsoring Japanese Buddhism and authoring its first text, once graced these waters.</description>

A fellow henro once told me, ‘When far from the temple, wake early; when close, rise later.’ Sleep is precious everywhere.
Still, I rise at 5:30 today because I woke naturally and I want breakfast. The Lawson close by has seats, which means I get to enjoy a dignified meal, seated, with my food laid out on the counter.</description>

I set my alarm for 5am and it’s barely twilight by the time I get out from the covers. Instantly, I regret laying out my dryish clothes last night; the humidity has tampered with them. Never mind. I pack and eat breakfast, finishing the rest of the cold barley tea from last night.</description>

Weather: Cloudy + Rain
Travel Method: Walking
Distance: 28 km
=====
Last night was meh. That sound synthesises a relatively comfortable spot (under a table), feeling comfortable (mostly not too hot or cold), a full belly (from snacks), general feeling of safety (could see incoming traffic), and a decent 8 hours of sleep (broken).
After forcing myself to sleep despite the sheen of sweat on my forehead, I drifted awake when the cool air sank in.</description>

=====
The day starts early, too unjustly early for a departure. This is a good life, a good home, a good river outside, with good hills.
We have breakfast and I pack the last items into my backpack as my host starts the car. Where did the morning go?
My host and I have our last good chat on the way to Kubokawa station, where she’ll drop me off on the way to work.</description>

 ‘Stay’ is a charming word in a friend’s vocabulary. – Louisa May Alcott  Stay has enticed travellers to lay down roots, caused vagabonds to give up their wanders. Mystics and monks in deep jungles and remote mountains entice nomads to become disciples and they never leave their hamlet retreats again. Whether spoken by a life-long friend or a newfound connection, the word has equal power when the stars align.</description>

My alarm goes off and I reluctantly unzip my tent flap, poke my head out, and sit up on the bench.
Cleaning up, packing, having breakfast, chugging half of the two-litre bottle to offload weight fill up my first hour. Whether I rush or take my time, I’ve discovered don’t stray far from this hour mark.</description>

=====
I wake up to a morning drizzle and check my foot. It’s still the size of a golfball, but curiously not an angry purple.
I’m lucky. A millimetre off and I would probably be back in Kochi City, in the hospital. I stop myself from looping yesterday’s fall in my head, from thinking about that one fateful moment, that one avoidable step.</description>

Today is a series of unfortunate events, but it started off beautifully.
I get up early to enjoy breakfast before leaving my Airbnb house. This is my chance to eat a full spread unlike the usual onigiri and snacks that I have on the go.</description>

While the coffee is brewing I drop a slice of sumomo, sour peach, in my mouth. In the bowl beside the red juicy cuts are yellow ones from the Tosa Buntan, a local pomelo-like fruit. My host brought them over from her parents’ house next door.</description>

My alarm goes off in the pitch-black room. I resent it with a passion I never felt when woken by sunshine and the cheerful birds after a sleepless nojuku night. In the fog of fatigue after a first good night’s rest, I drag myself out of the fluffy comforter and soft bed, change, and head downstairs for the complimentary breakfast.</description>

The birds begin chirping just before night melts into dawn. It’s not even 5:00am. I peek over at the henro on the other side of the hut. He hasn’t stirred. Feeling justified, I pull up my covers again.</description>

I woke up in the middle of the night only once, which is an accomplishment. I wake again in the dark before 5:00 because I had originally wanted to climb to the peak and see sunrise. Finally, my alarm goes off again at 6:00, and I’m behind schedule.</description>

My cell is going to die. That’s my first thought when I wake with it squashed under my shoulder, overheated and drained of the full battery it had last night. I can feel the film of sweat on my face, even though I woke up several times from the breeze that carried increasingly cool air.</description>

Morning. Fold futon. Open curtains. Sunshine. It rained. Pack. Eat.
I move around as quietly as I can. Aurelie is still sleeping, and I enjoy extending morning quiet before the day begins.
At some point, something clatters and I hear Aurelie wake.</description>

Temples: None.
Weather: Heavy Rain. Light Rain.
Travel Method: Train
Distance: (+14) 17.7 km
=====
The sound of droplets wash away the haze of sleep. There’s something soothing about waking to the sound of rain. It was too hot to sleep well last night, and I eventually dozed off as light seeped in from the upper window. It was my first time doing nojuku (‘camping’ out), and this wheelchair accessible toilet at the Hiwasa Michi-no-Eki was entirely improvised.</description>

A clatter of voices and footsteps outside my door wakes me up. After it dies down, I roll over and push myself up groggily. I pack my bag and put the futon back onto a stack in the corner. There are only the items I’m mailing left out on the floor, and the nokyocho that I’m leaving for the Mizutanis.</description>

The morning glow gradually fills my room, but I can’t shake the sleepy haze. Slowly, I feel the tightness of my thighs, the tense shoulder muscles. Suddenly, I feel my whole body as one heavy mass. Through the closed door, Ayumi’s gentle coaxing voice does a tango with Kotaro’s sputtered wails.</description>

The day starts briskly with a quick breakfast and a bike ride in the rain to catch the 8:16 train. It doesn’t seem a problem when I decide to go, but my morning commute from Kawata station in Awa City would take three hours to get to Bando, the stop closest to the first temple of the pilgrimage.</description>
