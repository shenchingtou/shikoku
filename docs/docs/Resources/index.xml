      <description>Increasingly, the Shikoku Pilgrimage has become a longer-term travel experience for backpackers in Japan, Buddhist pilgrims, and cultural and history enthusiasts. The Shikoku Pilgrimage is a roughly 1200-kilometre circle around the whole island, covering 88 temples and 20 bangai (side) temples. Below are, I have compiled frequently asked questions from friends and my Shikoku Pilgrimage diary readers who are considering visiting the temples, or undertaking the full journey.

      <title>Shikoku Pilgrimage Packing List</title>

      <description>This is a packing list mostly for people who intend to walk the Shikoku Pilgrimage, though it can be adapted by backpackers who want to camp through the Japanese countryside. People who are driving or taking the bus will likely not have as many weight constraints and can pack more clothes. I have tried to outline the guiding principles for a Japan / long-distance walking packing list, so that you can use them to work through the gear that is suggested and adapt them as necessary based on the seasons.</description>

      <title>Shikoku Henro Budget &amp; Free Lodging Guide (English &amp; Japanese)</title>
      <link>https://shenchingtou.github.io/shikoku/docs/Resources/shikoku-lodging-list/</link>

      <description>This post is an update from the Henro free/budget lodging list that I had compiled back in 2015 because information at the time was hard to find online, but more readily available after I started meeting other henro on the road. The henro whom I exchanged lists with spoke Japanese, so the information sometimes differed from the English ones, which is why I compiled them. This updated accommodations and lodging list is not necessarily exhaustive, but I have added more information based on information received from pilgrims after 2015.</description>

      <title>My Shikoku Pilgrimage Budget Sheet</title>

      <description>Japan is often an expensive place to travel, but that is often due to lack of familiarity with accommodation and dining options. The same principle is true for the Shikoku Pilgrimage. This post breaks down the cost of my 40-day walking trip into daily expenses. I explain section by section why the costs were that way so that you can see what options are available to you. This is a shoestring budget, so a more accurate budget should be around US$3000 for the trip itself (not including airfare).</description>

      <description>This is a comprehensive guide for people who would like to climb Mount Ishizuchi, the tallest mountain in Western Japan.
